Variable response of Red Sea coral communities to recent disturbance events along a latitudinal gradient	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Coral bleaching; Radiometric (U-Th) age-dating; Saudi Arabia; Life and death assemblages	DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; REEF RESILIENCE; MODERN PORITES; TRAJECTORIES; DECLINE; GROWTH; WATER	Coral reefs are experiencing a dramatic loss of hard coral abundance and associated habitat structure from a myriad of local and global factors. Here, utilizing U-Th radiometric age-dating of coral death assemblages, we investigated patterns of coral mortality from the eastern margin of the Red Sea along a latitudinal gradient (Yanbu, 24(o) N; Thuwal, 22(o) N; Al-Lith, 19(o) N; Farasan Banks, 18(o) N) in 2018 and 2019. In all four regions, radiometric ages of in situ dead Acropora and Pocillopora colonies were largely confined to the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. During the early twenty-first century, coral mortality was found to be synchronous with previously documented bleaching events in 2010 and 2015 and, at one site (Farasan Banks), an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) in 2009. The most northern site, Yanbu, had the highest relative percentage of live coral (42 +/- 4%) and of living Acropora, and may serve as a refugium under climate warming scenarios. For the three southern regions (Thuwal, Al-Lith, Farasan Banks) benthic structure was mostly comprised of dead corals. The southernmost survey site, Farasan Banks, underwent a dramatic change in coral benthic structure associated with a COTS outbreak in 2009 and a bleaching event in 2015, and had the lowest relative percentage of live coral (6 +/- 2%), comprised mostly of massive Porites, with no live Acropora or Pocillopora. Our results highlight the asynchronous impact of disturbance events on eastern Red Sea coral reefs and emphasize regional differences in recovery and ecosystem state.

Historical evaluations of the cumulative effects of exploitation for most recreationally targeted Australian fish stocks remain unexplored, as do the social and cultural contexts of recreational fishing. Historical newspaper articles were used to derive quantitative and qualitative catch data on Queensland's east coast barramundi, Lates calcarifer (Bloch), a popular species targeted by recreational fishers. Decadal-scale catch rates (1869-1952) were reconstructed, as was the development of the fishery since its earliest documentation. Models indicated a significant decline in catch rates, from an average of 5.20 kg /fishing trip (95% confidence interval, 3.82-7.09) in 1870-3.24 kg/fishing trip (95% CI 2.72-3.87) in 1952. Variability in catch rates was associated with a spatial and seasonal interaction effect, with average catch rates differing among regions and seasons. Qualitative analysis showed a northward expansion of the fishery along the east coast, coinciding with increasing number of locations fished, establishment of organised fishing clubs in the 1900s and concerns of overexploitation starting in 1909. Integration of quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed past socio-cultural factors and trends in the barramundi fishery, while building confidence in the reliability of inferences made from archival data sets.

Integrating environmental variability to broaden the research on coral responses to future ocean conditions	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change experiments; coral reef; environmental variability; heatwaves; in-situ buoy data; pCO(2); temperature	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUFFER CAPACITY; REEF CORALS; ACIDIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; CALCIFICATION; OXYGEN; PCO(2); FORMULATION; THRESHOLDS	Our understanding of the response of reef-building corals to changes in their physical environment is largely based on laboratory experiments, analysis of long-term field data, and model projections. Experimental data provide unique insights into how organisms respond to variation of environmental drivers. However, an assessment of how well experimental conditions cover the breadth of environmental conditions and variability where corals live successfully is missing. Here, we compiled and analyzed a globally distributed dataset of in-situ seasonal and diurnal variability of key environmental drivers (temperature, pCO(2), and O-2) critical for the growth and livelihood of reef-building corals. Using a meta-analysis approach, we compared the variability of environmental conditions assayed in coral experimental studies to current and projected conditions in their natural habitats. We found that annual temperature profiles projected for the end of the 21st century were characterized by distributional shifts in temperatures with warmer winters and longer warm periods in the summer, not just peak temperatures. Furthermore, short-term hourly fluctuations of temperature and pCO(2) may regularly expose corals to conditions beyond the projected average increases for the end of the 21st century. Coral reef sites varied in the degree of coupling between temperature, pCO(2), and dissolved O-2, which warrants site-specific, differentiated experimental approaches depending on the local hydrography and influence of biological processes on the carbonate system and O-2 availability. Our analysis highlights that a large portion of the natural environmental variability at short and long timescales is underexplored in experimental designs, which may provide a path to extend our understanding on the response of corals to global climate change.

Projecting coral responses to intensifying marine heatwaves under ocean acidification	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; coral bleaching; endosymbiosis; greenhouse gas emissions scenario; ocean warming	DEGREES-C; METAANALYSIS; IMPACTS; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; REEFS; PLOTS	Over this century, coral reefs will run the gauntlet of climate change, as marine heatwaves (MHWs) become more intense and frequent, and ocean acidification (OA) progresses. However, we still lack a quantitative assessment of how, and to what degree, OA will moderate the responses of corals to MHWs as they intensify throughout this century. Here, we first projected future MHW intensities for tropical regions under three future greenhouse gas emissions scenario (representative concentration pathways, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the near-term (2021-2040), mid-century (2041-2060) and late-century (2081-2100). We then combined these MHW intensity projections with a global data set of 1,788 experiments to assess coral attribute performance and survival under the three emissions scenarios for the near-term, mid-century and late-century in the presence and absence of OA. Although warming and OA had predominately additive impacts on the coral responses, the contribution of OA in affecting most coral attributes was minor relative to the dominant role of intensifying MHWs. However, the addition of OA led to greater decreases in photosynthesis and survival under intermediate and unrestricted emissions scenario for the mid- and late-century than if intensifying MHWs were considered as the only driver. These results show that role of OA in modulating coral responses to intensifying MHWs depended on the focal coral attribute and extremity of the scenario examined. Specifically, intensifying MHWs and OA will cause increasing instances of coral bleaching and substantial declines in coral productivity, calcification and survival within the next two decades under the low and intermediate emissions scenario. These projections suggest that corals must rapidly adapt or acclimatize to projected ocean conditions to persist, which is far more likely under a low emissions scenario and with increasing efforts to manage reefs to enhance resilience.

Although attributed to a combination of local and global human stressors, the lack of long-term data on Caribbean reef coral communities has prevented a clear understanding of the causes and consequences of coral declines. We integrated paleoecological, historical, and modern survey data to track the occurrence of major coral species and life-history groups throughout the Caribbean from the prehuman period to the present. The regional loss of Acropora corals beginning by the 1960s from local human disturbances resulted in increases in the occurrence of formerly subdominant stress-tolerant and weedy scleractinian corals and the competitive hydrozoan Millepora beginning in the 1970s and 1980s. These transformations have resulted in the homogenization of coral communities within individual countries. However, increases in stress-tolerant and weedy corals have slowed or reversed since the 1980s and 1990s in tandem with intensified coral bleaching and disease. These patterns reveal the long history of increasingly stressful environmental conditions on Caribbean reefs that began with widespread local human disturbances and have recently culminated in the combined effects of local and global change.

Janzen-Connell effects partially supported in reef-building corals: adult presence interacts with settler density to limit establishment	OIKOS			English	Article						community ecology; coral recruitment; density-dependence; diversity maintenance; Janzen-Connell; sessile marine invertebrate	LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; POCILLOPORA-DAMICORNIS; SPATIAL AGGREGATION; DEPENDENT SURVIVAL; HERMATYPIC CORALS; LARVAL DISPERSAL; MORTALITY; MARINE; RECRUITMENT	In many plant and sessile marine invertebrate (SMI) taxa, population and community dynamics are heavily influenced by processes occurring during the dispersal and establishment phases. The Janzen-Connell (J-C) hypothesis predicts increased survival of early life stages with decreasing conspecific density and increased distance from conspecific adults. Evidence of J-C effects in maintaining diversity is common in plant communities, but its importance in SMI communities remains unclear. Under controlled aquarium conditions, we examined the effect of density-dependence and adult conspecific water treatments (absent/present) on propagule settlement success and settler post-settlement survival, along with associated spatial patterns, for six broadcast-spawning, reef-building coral species from three families. We also tested if settlement success was linked to increasing propagule species diversity for three coral species from two families. We found that the probability of settlement was density independent and not influenced by adult present water treatments. Yet, adult present water treatments and settler density did have a synergistic negative effect on the probability of short-term settler survival for all species examined. Settlers also showed greater spatial aggregation as their numbers increased, but were less aggregated in adult present water treatments compared to those in adult absent water treatments. We further show evidence of significant species interactions among propagules, as settlement in single-species trials was four-fold higher compared to mixed-species trials. Our findings from controlled experimental arenas indicate that the early establishment of corals was predominantly limited by density-dependent settler-adult interactions among conspecifics and propagule-propagule interactions among heterospecifics. Thus, the proximity to established conspecific adults, settler density and species diversity of propagules are relevant drivers of local coral community diversity and structure.

We aimed to carry out a quantitative assessment of the link between reef coral traits and species extinction risk informed by extinctions of reef corals observed in the fossil record. Location Global. Time period Plio-Pleistocene and present day. Major taxa studied Scleractinian reef corals. Methods We used morphological traits, phylogenetic information and evidence of extinction during the Plio-Pleistocene to predict the extinction risk of contemporary reef corals. Our model was trained using 138 Caribbean fossil coral species and an automatic machine learning algorithm. We then used this model to predict the extinction risk of 674 modern coral species. Results Model validation confirmed 77% accuracy in predicting extinction risk of fossil corals. Extinction risk predicted by our model showed a near-random (57%) match with the IUCN conservation status. Our model also suggested that corals in the Least Concern or Near Threatened categories might be at higher risk of extinction than currently believed. Main conclusions Morphological traits of fossil corals linked to their extinction risk in the Plio-Pleistocene Caribbean Sea are known to reflect the vulnerability of extant corals. However, the results from our fossil-calibrated model do not match the IUCN assessment of reef corals, with increased overall extinction risk. This does not necessarily indicate near-future extinction risk, because fossil extinctions are spread over thousands of years. However, we show the applicability of using fossil data to inform the extinction risk of modern corals and recommend that future assessments of extinction risk of reef corals should consider incorporating the relationship between morphological traits and resilience, calibrated by fossil data, to maximize the utility of the extinction risk assessment.

The ensuing demographic changes to coral assemblages can have long-term impacts on reef community organisation. Thus, understanding the dynamics of subtropical scleractinian coral populations is essential to predict their recovery or extinction post-disturbance. Here we present a 10-yr demographic assessment of a subtropical endemic coral, Pocillopora aliciae (Schmidt-Roach et al. in Zootaxa 3626:576-582, 2013) from the Solitary Islands Marine Park, eastern Australia, paired with long-term temperature records. These coral populations are regularly affected by storms, undergo seasonal thermal variability, and are increasingly impacted by severe marine heatwaves. We examined the demographic processes governing the persistence of these populations using inference from size-frequency distributions based on log-transformed planar area measurements of 7196 coral colonies. Specifically, the size-frequency distribution mean, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, and coral density were applied to describe population dynamics. Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Models were used to determine temporal trends and test demographic responses to heat stress. Temporal variation in size-frequency distributions revealed various population processes, from recruitment pulses and cohort growth, to bleaching impacts and temperature dependencies. Sporadic recruitment pulses likely support population persistence, illustrated in 2010 by strong positively skewed size-frequency distributions and the highest density of juvenile corals measured during the study. Increasing mean colony size over the following 6 yr indicates further cohort growth of these recruits. Severe heat stress in 2016 resulted in mass bleaching mortality and a 51% decline in coral density. Moderate heat stress in the following years was associated with suppressed P. aliciae recruitment and a lack of early recovery, marked by an exponential decrease of juvenile density (i.e. recruitment) with increasing heat stress. Here, population reliance on sporadic recruitment and susceptibility to heat stress underpin the vulnerability of subtropical coral assemblages to climate change.

Trait-based approach reveals how marginal reefs respond to acute and chronic disturbance	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Turbid; Flood; Traits; Sedimentation; Marginal; High latitude; Disturbance	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; CORAL-REEFS; ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS; ASSEMBLY RULES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; HIGH-LATITUDE; HERVEY BAY; COMMUNITIES	Ecosystems worldwide are becoming increasingly altered by environmental stress, yet little is known about how acute disturbances affect ecological communities that already persist under chronically stressful environmental conditions. Here, we use a trait-based approach to understand the effects of repeated flooding on the subtropical reefs of Hervey Bay, Australia (25 South) that are considered marginal both in terms of their chronically turbid and high-latitude settings. We quantify variation in taxonomic and functional composition of coral assemblages along spatial gradients of water quality, before and after three flooding events of the Mary River between 2010 and 2013. We demonstrate systematic variation in taxonomic and functional composition along distance from shore and rivers and show remarkable stability of patterns over the course of repeated flooding. This is likely because the reefs of Hervey Bay are regularly exposed to resuspension of sediments, limiting the types of species that are able to persist in these chronically turbid settings, with flood events reinforcing the longer-term stress regime. Greater similarity of co-occurring species on nearshore reefs than expected by chance also supports this hypothesis. Corallite size, coral morphology, the ability to remove sediment, and propagule development rate best explained variation in coral assemblage structure. Specifically, reefs closer to shore and to rivers were characterised by species with large corallites, high sediment removal ability and foliose morphology, strategies considered beneficial in turbid conditions. Among individual traits, symbiont transmission best explained variation in assemblage structure, and it is plausible that the acquisition of locally adapted symbionts from the environment is advantageous in the turbid and light-limited conditions of nearshore reefs. These findings highlight the importance of tolerance to turbidity and sedimentation in driving coral biodiversity patterns in Hervey Bay, with acute flooding reinforcing the long-term stress regime that controls the distribution of species on these marginal reefs.

Climate-driven impacts of exotic species on marine ecosystems	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						alien; climate change; environmental matching; invasive; non&#8208; native; temperature	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; RANGE SHIFTS; BIODIVERSITY; PHYSIOLOGY; FORECASTS; LIMITS	Aim Temperature is fundamental to the physiological and ecological performance of marine organisms, but its role in modulating the magnitude of ecological impacts by exotic species remains unresolved. Here, we examine the relationship between thermal regimes in the range of origin of marine exotic species and sites of measured impact, after human-induced introduction. We compare this relationship with the magnitude of impact exerted by exotic species on native ecosystems. Location Global. Time period 1977-2017 (meta-analysis). Major taxa studied Marine exotic species. Methods Quantitative impacts of exotic species in marine ecosystems were obtained from a global database. The native range of origin of exotic species was used to estimate the realized thermal niche for each species and compared with the latitude and climatic conditions in recipient sites of recorded impact of exotic species. The difference in median temperatures between recipient sites and the thermal range of origin (i.e., thermal midpoint anomaly) was compared with the magnitude of effect sizes by exotic species on native species, communities and ecosystems. Results Recorded impacts occurred predominantly within the thermal niche of origin of exotic species, albeit with a tendency toward higher latitudes and slightly cooler conditions. The severity of impacts by exotic species on abundance of native taxa displayed a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. Peak impacts were recorded in recipient sites that were 2.2 degrees C cooler than the thermal midpoint of the range of origin of exotic species, and impacts decreased in magnitude toward higher and lower thermal anomalies. Main conclusions Our findings highlight how temperature and climatic context influence ecological impacts by exotic species in marine ecosystems and the implications for existing and novel species interactions under climate change.

Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef Are Understudied and Underexplored	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						deep coral reefs; deep reef refuge hypothesis; Australia; Red Sea; prioritize research; management needs; trend projection; Holt-Winters model		Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are characterized by the presence of photosynthetically active organisms such as corals and algae, and associated communities at depths ranging from 30 to 150 m in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to the increased awareness of the potential importance of these reefs as an integral part of coral reef ecosystems (i.e., deep reef refuge, specialized biodiversity, transition zone between shallow and deep-sea environments, and recreational and intrinsic values), interest from the scientific community has grown around the world over the last two decades. Several nations have already made management declarations and started to extend marine protected areas and fishery management to MCEs. The estimated area of Australian MCEs is likely equivalent to that of shallow reef ecosystems down to 30 m; however, Australian MCEs attract limited research effort compared to other major coral reef regions around the world. In this perspective, we briefly explore the reasons for this scarcity of research on mesophotic ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) of Australia (e.g., strict diving regulations, new researchers' involvement, and logistics and cost). At present, research efforts on the mesophotic ecosystems of the GBR are in decline and if this trajectory is maintained, the global disparity in knowledge between MCEs near Australia and those from the other main coral reef regions worldwide will sharpen deeply. We call for action from the research community, grant agencies, and decision-makers toward a wider understanding of these important ecosystems in Australia.

Yet, the mid- and long-term thermal stress responses of corals in subtropical environments remain largely unquantified, limiting our capacity to predict their future viability. The annual survival, growth and recruitment of 311 individual corals within the Solitary Islands Marine Park (Australia) was recorded over a 3-year period (2016-2018), including the 2015/2016 thermal stress event. These data were used to parameterise integral projection models quantifying the effect of thermal stress within a subtropical coral assemblage. Stochastic simulations were also applied to evaluate the implications of recurrent thermal stress scenarios predicted by four different Representative Concentration Pathways. We report differential shifts in population growth rates (lambda) among coral populations during both stress and non-stress periods, confirming contrasting bleaching responses among taxa. However, even during non-stress periods, the observed dynamics for all taxa were unable to maintain current community composition, highlighting the need for external recruitment sources to support the community structure. Across all coral taxa, projected stochastic growth rates (lambda(s)) were found to be lowest under higher emissions scenarios. Correspondingly, predicted increases in recurrent thermal stress regimes may accelerate the loss of coral coverage, species diversity and structural complexity within subtropical regions. We suggest that these trends are primarily due to the susceptibility of subtropical specialists and endemic species, such asPocillopora aliciae, to thermal stress. Similarly, the viability of many tropical coral populations at higher latitudes is highly dependent on the persistence of up-current tropical systems. As such, the inherent dynamics of subtropical coral populations appear unable to support their future persistence under unprecedented thermal disturbance scenarios.

We developed a robust methodology to detect novel communities, examine patterns of emergence, and quantify probabilities of local demographic turnover in transitions to and from novel communities. Using a global dataset of Cenozoic marine plankton communities, we found that the probability of local extinction, origination, and emigration during transitions to a novel community increased two to four times that of background community changes. Although rare, novel communities were five times more likely than chance to shift into another novel state. For marine plankton communities at a 100,000-year time grain, novel communities were sensitive to further extinctions and substantial community change.

Nutrient-supplying ocean currents modulate coral bleaching susceptibility	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SKELETAL RECORDS; RED-SEA; PORITES; STRESS; ENRICHMENT; INCREASE; TEMPERATURE; AUSTRALIA	With predictions that mass coral bleaching will occur annually within this century, conservation efforts must focus their limited resources based on an accurate understanding of the drivers of bleaching. Here, we provide spatial and temporal evidence that excess nutrients exacerbate the detrimental effects of heat stress to spark mass coral bleaching in the Red Sea. Exploiting this region's unique oceanographic regime, where nutrients and heat stress vary independently, we demonstrate that the world's third largest coral reef system historically suffered from severe mass bleaching only when exposed to both unusually high temperature and nutrients. Incorporating nutrient-supplying ocean currents and their variability into coral bleaching forecasts will be critical for effectively guiding efforts to safeguard the reefs most likely to persist in the Anthropocene.

Something old, something new: Historical perspectives provide lessons for blue growth agendas	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article						ecosystem services; environmental history; fisheries; historical ecology; marine policy; sustainable development	ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE USE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; KEY PRINCIPLES; MARINE; FISHERIES; FISH; SEA; ECOLOGY; NORTH	The concept of "blue growth," which aims to promote the growth of ocean economies while holistically managing marine socioecological systems, is emerging within national and international marine policy. The concept is often promoted as being novel; however, we show that historical analogies exist that can provide insights for contemporary planning and implementation of blue growth. Using a case-study approach based on expert knowledge, we identified 20 historical fisheries or aquaculture examples from 13 countries, spanning the last 40-800 years, that we contend embody blue growth concepts. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that blue growth has been investigated across such broad spatial and temporal scales. The past societies managed to balance exploitation with equitable access, ecological integrity and/or economic growth for varying periods of time. Four main trajectories existed that led to the success or failure of blue growth. Success was linked to equitable rather than open access, innovation and management that was responsive, holistic and based on scientific knowledge and monitoring. The inability to achieve or maintain blue growth resulted from failures to address limits to industry growth and/or anticipate the impacts of adverse extrinsic events and drivers (e.g. changes in international markets, war), the prioritization of short-term gains over long-term sustainability, and loss of supporting systems. Fourteen cross-cutting lessons and 10 recommendations were derived that can improve understanding and implementation of blue growth. Despite the contemporary literature broadly supporting our findings, these recommendations are not adequately addressed by agendas seeking to realize blue growth.

Regional variation in delta C-13 of coral reef macroalgae	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							INORGANIC CARBON USE; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; RNA-DNA RATIO; CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; ELEMENTAL STOICHIOMETRY; ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; WATER-QUALITY; CO2; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH	Macroalgae are important components on coral reefs that underpin food webs but are also indicators of declines in coral reef condition. The sensitivity of macroalgal communities to environmental factors, including climate and pollutants from the land, is important for the future state of coral reefs. We assessed regional variation in the photosynthetic physiology of macroalgae on the Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, using delta C-13, tissue chemistry, and metabolic indicators over broad environmental gradients from six sites spanning 13 degrees of latitude and varying distance from shore. Our data set included 568 samples from 54 genera and 19 macroalgal orders. The delta C-13 of tissues had a strong taxonomic basis (explaining 66% of the variation in delta C-13), varying significantly among algal orders. Particularly low values of delta C-13, indicating direct use of CO2(aq) in photosynthesis, were mainly associated with lineages within the Rhodophyta. We observed declines in delta C-13 with increasing depth (inshore only) and latitude, from offshore to inshore sites and with increasing tissue N and N : P ratio. Variation in delta C-13 of tissues among macroalgal lineages suggests evolution of a range of CO2 acquisition pathways. Patterns in delta C-13 availability are most consistent with higher availability of CO2(aq) in cooler water and inshore sites. delta C-13 in macroalgae could provide an important tool for monitoring changes in CO2(aq) with increasing atmospheric CO2, with changes in ocean circulation and with changes to runoff from the land to the coastal oceans.

Variation in the elemental stoichiometry of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Carbon; Ecological stoichiometry; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Symbiodiniaceae	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; PHOSPHORUS-METABOLISM; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; LIZARD ISLAND; HOST; TEMPERATURE; LIMITATION; ORGANISMS; WATER	Organismal elemental stoichiometry is important at all scales of ecological interactions, particularly in symbiosis. Symbiotic partnerships are found extensively in corals, where coral hosts and their photosynthetic dinoflagellate partners trade essential nutrients. Using an ecological stoichiometry framework, we assessed variations in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations in coral hosts and symbiotic zooxanthellae. Our aim was to assess whether corals and zooxanthellae differ in the stoichiometry of C, N and P, which may indicate that corals regulate their symbionts by restricting their access to nutrients. We also investigated the influence of biological and environmental factors on the elemental stoichiometry of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis. Analysing field data from four locations on the Great Barrier Reef using boosted regression tree models, we observed that C:P and N:P ratios are significantly higher in zooxanthellae than in their coral hosts, suggesting P limitation for zooxanthellae, although the degree of P or N limitation in zooxanthellae varied among coral taxa. Coral taxonomy was also a significant driver of coral-zooxanthellae stoichiometry variations at the species level. Geographical location had a small influence on the variations in stoichiometry. Our analyses suggest that coral species may differentially control the access of zooxanthellae to nutrients which may lead to variation in reef coral responses to nutrient enrichment.

Widespread loss of Caribbean acroporid corals was underway before coral bleaching and disease outbreaks	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							WHITE-BAND DISEASE; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; PHASE-SHIFTS; ALTERNATIVE STATES; MASS MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELKHORN CORAL; REEFS; PALMATA; RESILIENCE	The mass mortality of acroporid corals has transformed Caribbean reefs from coral- to macroalgal-dominated habitats since systematic monitoring began in the 1970s. Declines have been attributed to overfishing, pollution, sea urchin and coral disease, and climate change, but the mechanisms are unresolved due to the dearth of pre-1970s data. We used paleoecological, historical, and survey data to track Acropora presence and dominance throughout the Caribbean from the prehuman period to present. Declines in dominance from prehuman values first occurred in the 1950s for Acropora palmata and the 1960s for Acropora cervicornis, decades before outbreaks of acroporid disease or bleaching. We compared trends in Acropora dominance since 1950 to potential regional and local drivers. Human population negatively affected and consumption of fertilizer for agriculture positively affected A. palmata dominance, the latter likely due to lower human presence in agricultural areas. The earlier, local roots of Caribbean Acropora declines highlight the urgency of mitigating local human impacts.

Defining variation in pre-human ecosystems can guide conservation: An example from a Caribbean coral reef	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BOCAS-DEL-TORO; LONG-TERM DECLINE; BASE-LINES; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; ATLANTIC; TIME; MORTALITY; IMPACTS; HISTORY; COMMUNITIES	Many Caribbean coral reefs are heavily degraded, yet their pre-human, natural states are often assumed or estimated using space-for-time substitution approaches. Here we use an 11-hectare suite of fossilised mid-Holocene (7.2-5.6ka) fringing reefs in Caribbean Panama to define natural variation in hard coral community structure before human-impact to provide context to the states of the same reefs today. We collected bulk samples from four trenches dug into the mid-Holocene fossil reef and surficial bulk samples from 2-10m depths on five adjacent modern reefs extending over 5km. Analysis of the abundances of coral taxa in fossil bulk samples define the Historical Range of Variation (HRV) in community structure of the reefs. When compared to the community structure of adjacent modern reefs, we find that most coral communities today fall outside the HRV, identifying them as novel ecosystems and corroborating the well-documented transition from acroporid-dominated Caribbean reefs to reefs dominated by stress-tolerant taxa (Porites and Agaricia). We find one modern reef, however, whose community composition remains within the HRV showing that it has not transitioned to a novel state. Reef-matrix cores extracted from this reef reveal that the coral community has remained in this state for over 800 years, suggesting long-term stability and resistance to the region-wide shift to novel states. Without these data to provide historical context, this potentially robust and stable reef would be overlooked since it does not fulfil expectations of what a Caribbean coral reef should look like in the absence of humans. This example illustrates how defining past variation using the fossil record can improve our understanding of modern degradation and guide conservation.

Patch size drives settlement success and spatial distribution of coral larvae under space limitation	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Coral; Recruitment; Settlement; Patch size; Space limitation; Gregarious; Chimera	SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; RECRUITMENT; POPULATION; MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY; AVAILABILITY; CONSEQUENCES; COMPETITION	Space availability is a key factor linked to the settlement success of marine invertebrates. Settlement space on coral reefs is predicted to become increasingly fragmented and occupied by competitors under future disturbance regimes, yet how this impacts coral settlement remains largely unknown. We test the effects of space limitation on larval settlement in three common Indo-Pacific corals (Acropora valida, Acropora digitifera and Anacropora spinosa) by manipulating substrate area while maintaining a constant larval supply. Settlement success was highly variable among coral species, with reduced space leading to an up to four-fold increase in settlement of A. valida larvae, a two-fold decrease in settlement of An. spinosa larvae and no significant effect for A. digitifera. All species displayed similar spatial settlement patterns, whereby larvae settled gregariously irrespective of how much space was available. At the same time, settlers were found to increasingly occur in aggregates (in direct contact with each other) as space decreased. We propose that increased settler aggregations, coupled with settlement intensification for some species, facilitates the formation of chimeras as space becomes limiting. In colonial organisms, the formation of aggregates and particularly chimeric individuals may offset the negative effects of increased competition for space by allowing settlers to rapidly exceed size-escape thresholds, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival.

A U-Th Dating Approach to Understanding Past Coral Reef Dynamics and Geomorphological Constraints on Future Reef Growth Potential; Mazie Bay, Southern Great Barrier Reef	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL; FRINGING-REEF; HALF-LIVES; ISLAND; PRECISION; ACCRETION; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; RECOVERY; REVEALS	Reconstructing coral reef histories provides a window of understanding into reef response to changing environmental and climatic conditions over various temporal scales. Here we present the results of 117 U-Th dates from emergent reef flat and slope cores and surface death assemblages, combined with previously published fossil microatoll data, to capture the entire sequence of reef growth at Mazie Bay, inshore Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Coral U-Th dates indicate that Mazie Bay reef initiated similar to 6,900 years before present (yr. BP) quickly filling accommodation space. While rates of vertical reef accretion (5.3 +/- 1.0 mm year(-1)) were comparable to the GBR average during the mid-Holocene (similar to 5.0 mm year(-1)), reef flat progradation occurred at a rate 1.5- to 6-fold previous GBR rates until 5,100 yr. BP (similar to 70.4 cm year(-1)). Average progradation slowed to similar to 7.1 cm year(-1) in the subsequent similar to 4,000 years and reef slope cores indicate this reef had largely "turned-off" by 400 yr. BP, with modern coral communities existing as a veneer over the largely senescent framework. Death assemblage dates highlight coral disturbance and recovery regimes in response to increased cyclone activity 1960-1985 AD and recent extreme sea surface temperature and flood events post 2000 AD. U-Th dating of mid-Holocene to modern coral deposits from Mazie Bay reef provides a unique insight into past reef development, response to recent disturbance regimes, and potential for future reef growth. In the case of Mazie Bay, our data suggest limited accommodation space and increased occurrence of sea surface temperature extremes will restrict future reef growth at this site.

Ecological effects of non-native species in marine ecosystems relate to co-occurring anthropogenic pressures	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						alien; anthropogenic impacts; exotic; global change; introduction; invasive	IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITIES; DENSITY; PLANTS	Predictors for the ecological effects of non-native species are lacking, even though such knowledge is fundamental to manage non-native species and mitigate their impacts. Current theories suggest that the ecological effects of non-native species may be related to other concomitant anthropogenic stressors, but this has not been tested at a global scale. We combine an exhaustive meta-analysis of the ecological effects of marine non-native species with human footprint proxies to determine whether the ecological changes due to non-native species are modulated by co-occurring anthropogenic impacts. We found that non-native species had greater negative effects on native biodiversity where human population was high and caused reductions in individual performance where cumulative human impacts were large. On this basis we identified several marine ecoregions where non-native species may have the greatest ecological effects, including areas in the Mediterranean Sea and along the northwest coast of the United States. In conclusion, our global assessment suggests coexisting anthropogenic impacts can intensify the ecological effects of non-native species.

High resolution geochemical analysis of massive Porites spp. corals from the Wet Tropics, Great Barrier Reef: rare earth elements, yttrium and barium as indicators of terrigenous input	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Rare earth elements; Yttrium; Barium/calcium; Coral geochemical proxies; Great Barrier Reef; Water quality	RIVER CATCHMENT; FLUORESCENT BANDS; LUMINESCENT LINES; COASTAL SEAWATER; TRACE-ELEMENTS; BURDEKIN RIVER; RECORDS; VARIABILITY; BA/CA; FLOOD	Catchment modification and increased sediment loads in coastal regions are impacting many of the world's coral reefs, yet relevant water quality data are limited by the availability of instrumental records. Massive Porites spp. corals offer the potential to reconstruct water quality by use of the geochemical proxies that are incorporated into their skeleton. Here we present - monthly resolved rare earth element (REE), yttrium (Y) and barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) concentrations obtained from four Porites corals collected across a known water quality gradient from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Sub-annual REE time series patterns were comparable among corals despite having significantly different concentrations. Whilst Ba/Ca did not reflect the known water quality gradient of the region, Y/holmium ratios reflected broad cross shelf water quality gradients and REE concentrations reflected local scale variance in water quality. This study demonstrates that REE analysis of Porites corals offers great potential for assessing changes in water quality in reef environments.	[Leonard, N. D.; Nguyen, A. D.; Clark, T.

Impact evaluation and conservation outcomes in marine protected areas: A case study of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Great Barrier Reef; Conservation; Impact evaluation; Impact; Marine protected area; No-take zone	LARGE-SCALE; RESERVES; FISH; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTIVITY; SPILLOVER; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; NETWORK	While marine protected areas are being expanded to meet international conservation targets and protect biodiversity from increasing anthropogenic threats, our understanding of the conservation impact of such interventions is limited. Hailed as a success globally, the rezoning of Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2004 was complex and controversial. Despite substantial research within the Marine park, little rigorous evaluation has been undertaken of the rezoning's biological impact - the difference increased protection has made to biodiversity relative to that expected without protection. We review available data of measures of biological impact from 'new' no-take zones established in the rezoning and those established under previous zoning. We found 48 studies reporting 782 measures of impact based on comparisons of biological indicators in no-take zones with fished areas. Overwhelmingly, impacts were neutral (57%) or positive (33%). Few data supported causal relationships between new no-take zones and improvements in biological indicators (48 of 159 impacts). The probability of a positive impact increased with time from establishment of no-take zones. Limited conclusions can be drawn from other data. We evaluated whether these measures of impact were robust based on analysis of six key principles of impact evaluation. Sampling was not designed to support causal inferences. Biological monitoring and evaluation designs were limited in providing evidence of the impact of protection. Improved methods that include credible counterfactual data can address limitations of current practice. We highlight ways of progressing impact evaluation techniques to support causal inferences of the impact of marine protected areas generally.

Strategic conservation and management requires identification of the environmental and socioeconomic factors driving the persistence of scleractinian coral assemblages-the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems. Here, we compiled coral abundance data from 2,584 Indo-Pacific reefs to evaluate the influence of 21 climate, social and environmental drivers on the ecology of reef coral assemblages. Higher abundances of framework-building corals were typically associated with: weaker thermal disturbances and longer intervals for potential recovery; slower human population growth; reduced access by human settlements and markets; and less nearby agriculture. We therefore propose a framework of three management strategies (protect, recover or transform) by considering: (1) if reefs were above or below a proposed threshold of >10% cover of the coral taxa important for structural complexity and carbonate production; and (2) reef exposure to severe thermal stress during the 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event. Our findings can guide urgent management efforts for coral reefs, by identifying key threats across multiple scales and strategic policy priorities that might sustain a network of functioning reefs in the Indo-Pacific to avoid ecosystem collapse.

At species' range peripheries, environmental anomalies are particularly concerning because species often exist at their environmental tolerance limits and may not be able to migrate to escape unfavourable conditions. Here, we investigated the bleaching response and mortality of 14 coral genera across high-latitude eastern Australia during a global heat stress event in 2016. We evaluated whether the severity of assemblage-scale and genus-level bleaching responses was associated with cumulative heat stress and/or local environmental history, including long-term mean temperatures during the hottest month of each year (SSTLTMAX), and annual fluctuations in water temperature (SSTVAR) and solar irradiance (PARZ(VAR)). The most severely-bleached genera included species that were either endemic to the region (Pocillopora aliciae) or rare in the tropics (e.g. Porites heronensis). Pocillopora spp., in particular, showed high rates of immediate mortality. Bleaching severity of Pocillopora was high where SSTLTMAX was low or PARZ(VAR) was high, whereas bleaching severity of Porites was directly associated with cumulative heat stress. While many tropical Acropora species are extremely vulnerable to bleaching, the Acropora species common at high latitudes, such as A. glauca and A. solitaryensis, showed little incidence of bleaching and immediate mortality. Two other regionally-abundant genera, Goniastrea and Turbinaria, were also largely unaffected by the thermal anomaly. The severity of assemblage-scale bleaching responses was poorly explained by the environmental parameters we examined. Instead, the severity of assemblage-scale bleaching was associated with local differences in species abundance and taxon-specific bleaching responses. The marked taxonomic disparity in bleaching severity, coupled with high mortality of high-latitude endemics, point to climate-driven simplification of assemblage structures and progressive homogenisation of reef functions at these high-latitude locations.

Coral reef conservation in the Anthropocene: Confronting spatial mismatches and prioritizing functions	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review						Coral reefs; Governance; Ecosystem function; Conservation; Management; Functional crisis	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FOOD SECURITY; PHASE-SHIFTS; FISH; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; RESILIENCE	The world's coral reefs are rapidly transforming, with decreasing coral cover and new species configurations. These new Anthropocene reefs pose a challenge for conservation; we can no longer rely on established management plans and actions designed to maintain the status quo when coral reef habitats, and the challenges they faced, were very different. The key questions now are: what do we want to conserve on Anthropocene reefs, why, and how? Trends in reef management over recent decades reveal rapid shifts in perceived threats, goals and solutions. Future reefs will be unlike anything previously seen by humans, and while their ability to support tourism or fisheries may be relatively resilient, our capacity to manage them may be constrained by their new species configurations. Furthermore, there is a growing spatial mismatch between the escalating scale of threats and current or planned responses. We present a blueprint for future reef conservation that recognizes the need to better understand the processes that maintain Anthropocene reefs, and the growing imperative to reform conservation efforts to address both specific local issues and larger-scale threats. The future of coral reef conservation is no longer one solely of localized action and stewardship; it requires practices and institutions operating at far larger scales than today.

Diversity Indopacific Network	The molecular biogeography of the Indo-Pacific: Testing hypotheses with multispecies genetic patterns	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						analysis of molecular variance; biogeographic provinces; biogeographic realms; comparative phylogeography; discordance; dispersal; distance-based redundancy analysis	CORAL TRIANGLE; R PACKAGE; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; SEASCAPE GENETICS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CONSERVATION; ECOREGIONS; COALESCENT	Aim To test hypothesized biogeographic partitions of the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean with phylogeographic data from 56 taxa, and to evaluate the strength and nature of barriers emerging from this test. Location The Indo-Pacific Ocean. Time period Pliocene through the Holocene. Major taxa studied Fifty-six marine species. Methods We tested eight biogeographic hypotheses for partitioning of the Indo-Pacific using a novel modification to analysis of molecular variance. Putative barriers to gene flow emerging from this analysis were evaluated for pairwise phi(ST), and these phi(ST) distributions were compared to distributions from randomized datasets and simple coalescent simulations of vicariance arising from the Last Glacial Maximum. We then weighed the relative contribution of distance versus environmental or geographic barriers to pairwise phi(ST) with a distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA). Results We observed a diversity of outcomes, although the majority of species fit a few broad biogeographic regions. Repeated coalescent simulation of a simple vicariance model yielded a wide distribution of pairwise phi(ST) that was very similar to empirical distributions observed across five putative barriers to gene flow. Three of these barriers had median phi(ST) that were significantly larger than random expectation. Only 21 of 52 species analysed with dbRDA rejected the null model. Among these, 15 had overwater distance as a significant predictor of pairwise phi(ST), while 11 were significant for geographic or environmental barriers other than distance. Main conclusions Although there is support for three previously described barriers, phylogeographic discordance in the Indo-Pacific Ocean indicates incongruity between processes shaping the distributions of diversity at the species and population levels. Among the many possible causes of this incongruity, genetic drift provides the most compelling explanation: given massive effective population sizes of Indo-Pacific species, even hard vicariance for tens of thousands of years can yield phi(ST )values that range from 0 to nearly 0.5.

While some exotic species are implicated in many species extinctions, others can provide benefits to the recipient communities. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify and synthesize the ecological effects of 76 exotic marine species (about 6% of the listed exotics) on ten variables in marine communities. These species caused an overall significant, but modest in magnitude (as indicated by a mean effect size of g < 0.2), decrease in ecological variables. Marine primary producers and predators were the most disruptive trophic groups of the exotic species. Approximately 10% (that is, 2 out of 19) of the exotic species assessed in at least three independent studies had significant impacts on native species. Separating the innocuous from the disruptive exotic species provides a basis for triage efforts to control the marine exotic species that have the most impact, thereby helping to meet Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

On the inshore Great Barrier Reef (GBR), palaeoecological studies show the collapse of the previously dominant coral Acropora from the impacts of degraded water quality associated with European colonization. Even more dramatic impacts can result in the replacement of corals by fleshy macroalgae on modern reefs, but their past distribution is unknown because they leave no fossil record. Here, we apply DNA metabarcoding and high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rDNA gene on palaeoenvironmental DNA (aeDNA) derived from sediment cores at two sites on Pandora Reef (GBR), to enhance palaeoecological studies by incorporating key soft-bodied taxa, including macroalgae. We compared temporal trends in this aeDNA record with those of coral genera derived from macrofossils. Multivariate analysis of 12 eukaryotic groups from the aeDNA community showed wide variability over the past 750 years. The occurrence of brown macroalgae was negatively correlated only with the dominant coral at both sites. The occurrence of coralline and green macroalgae was positively correlated with only the dominant coral at one of the sites, where we also observed a significant association between the whole coral community and the occurrence of each of the three macroalgae groups. Our results demonstrate that reef sediments can provide a valuable archive for understanding the past distribution and occurrence of important soft-bodied reef dwellers. Combining information from fossils and aeDNA provides an enhanced understanding of temporal changes of reefs ecosystems at decadal to millennial timescales.

Understanding interactions between plasticity, adaptation and range shifts in response to marine environmental change	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						climate change; marine ecology; phenotypic plasticity; range shift; species distribution; species range limits	CORAL-REEF FISH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOCAL ADAPTATION; SPECIES RANGE; BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; ACCLIMATION CAPACITY; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS	Climate change is leading to shifts in species geographical distributions, but populations are also probably adapting to environmental change at different rates across their range. Owing to a lack of natural and empirical data on the influence of phenotypic adaptation on range shifts of marine species, we provide a general conceptual model for understanding population responses to climate change that incorporates plasticity and adaptation to environmental change in marine ecosystems. We use this conceptual model to help inform where within the geographical range each mechanism will probably operate most strongly and explore the supporting evidence in species. We then expand the discussion from a single-species perspective to community-level responses and use the conceptual model to visualize and guide research into the important yet poorly understood processes of plasticity and adaptation. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

Identifying species threatened with local extinction in tropical reef fisheries using historical reconstruction of species occurrence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; LIFE-HISTORY; BASE-LINES; FISH; VULNERABILITY; RISK; CONSERVATION; RECOVERY; DEGRADATION; REDUNDANCY	Identifying the species that are at risk of local extinction in highly diverse ecosystems is a big challenge for conservation science. Assessments of species status are costly and difficult to implement in developing countries with diverse ecosystems due to a lack of species-specific surveys, species-specific data, and other resources. Numerous techniques are devised to determine the threat status of species based on the availability of data and budgetary limits. On this basis, we developed a framework that compared occurrence data of historically exploited reef species in Kenya from existing disparate data sources. Occurrence data from archaeological remains (750-1500CE) was compared with occurrence data of these species catch assessments, and underwater surveys (1991-2014CE). This comparison indicated that only 67 species were exploited over a 750 year period, 750-1500CE, whereas 185 species were landed between 1995 and 2014CE. The first step of our framework identified 23 reef species as threatened with local extinction. The second step of the framework further evaluated the possibility of local extinction with Bayesian extinction analyses using occurrence data from naturalists' species list with the existing occurrence data sources. The Bayesian extinction analysis reduced the number of reef species threatened with local extinction from 23 to 15. We compared our findings with three methods used for assessing extinction risk. Commonly used extinction risk methods varied in their ability to identify reef species that we identified as threatened with local extinction by our comparative and Bayesian method. For example, 12 of the 15 threatened species that we identified using our framework were listed as either least concern, unevaluated, or data deficient in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list. Piscivores and macro-invertivores were the only functional groups found to be locally extinct. Comparing occurrence data from disparate sources revealed a large number of historically exploited reef species that are possibly locally extinct. Our framework addressed biases such as uncertainty in priors, sightings and survey effort, when estimating the probability of local extinction. Our inexpensive method showed the value and potential for disparate data to fill knowledge gaps that exist in species extinction assessments.

Trends and transitions observed in an iconic recreational fishery across 140 years	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Amateur fishing; Fishers' ecological knowledge; Fishing power; Historical ecology; Pagnts auratus	FLORIDA-KEYS; BASE-LINES; AUSTRALIA; MANAGEMENT; COLLAPSE; ACCOUNTS; SYSTEM; IMPACT	Recreational fishing has taken place for centuries and is a globally popular activity, yet a lack of monitoring data means historical trends in recreational fisheries are often little understood compared to their commercial counterparts. We examined archival sources and conducted fisher interviews to examine changes in the Queensland recreational snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) fishery throughout its documented history. We extracted data spanning the past 140 years on technological innovations, catch rate trends, and social and regulatory change. Technological innovations were evident throughout the history of the recreational fishery. During the 1960s, 1990s and 2000s, several periods of rapid technological transition occurred, where a technology was adopted by > 50% of recreational fishers within 10 years of its introduction. Since the 1960s, the timing and rate of adoption of fish-finding technology by recreational fishers has kept pace with the commercial sector. These technological advances have profoundly increased recreational targeting ability, but despite these advances, recalled recreational catch rate trends demonstrated significant declines over the course of the 20th century. While minimum size limits have been imposed on the snapper fishery for over a century, in contrast, the introduction of recreational in-possession limits only commenced in the 1990s. At this time, the beginnings of a societal transition was also observed, where longstanding lake-all' attitudes towards fishing began to be replaced by a more conservation-minded ethic. This shift was driven in part by the changing regulatory landscape, as well as wider attitudinal change influenced by the media and shifting societal norms, although whether this led to a reduction in total recreational catch remains unclear due to a lack of fishery-wide monitoring data and the open access nature of the recreational fishery. This study demonstrates that in the absence of systematic data collection, archival sources and fisher interviews can contribute an interdisciplinary knowledge base for understanding and interpreting historical fishery trends.

Transcending data gaps: a framework to reduce inferential errors in ecological analyses	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Functional biogeography; functional diversity; functional trait; imputation; trait database	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; MISSING DATA; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; EXTINCTION RISK; TRAIT VARIATION; R PACKAGE; PATTERNS	The analysis of functional diversity (FD) has gained increasing importance due to its generality and utility in ecology. In particular, patterns in the spatial distribution and temporal change of FD are being used to predict locations and functional groups that are immediately vulnerable to global changes. A major impediment to the accurate measurement of FD is the pervasiveness of missing data in trait datasets. While such prevalent data gaps can engender misleading inferences in FD analyses, we currently lack any practical guide to handle missing data in trait datasets. Here, we identify significant mismatches between true FD and values derived from datasets that contain missing data. We demonstrate that imputing missing data with a phylogeny-informed approach reduces the risk of misinterpretation of FD patterns, and provides baseline information against which central questions in ecology can be evaluated.

Climate Velocity Can Inform Conservation in a Warming World	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							RANGE SHIFTS; PROTECTED AREAS; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; MARINE; CONNECTIVITY; DISPERSAL; FUTURE; FISH; BIODIVERSITY	Climate change is shifting the ranges of species. Simple predictive metrics of range shifts such as climate velocity, that do not require extensive knowledge or data on individual species, could help to guide conservation. We review research on climate velocity, describing the theory underpinning the concept and its assumptions. We highlight how climate velocity has already been applied in conservation-related research, including climate residence time, climate refugia, endemism, historic and projected range shifts, exposure to climate change, and climate connectivity. Finally, we discuss ways to enhance the use of climate velocity in conservation through tailoring it to be more biologically meaningful, informing design of protected areas, conserving ocean biodiversity in 3D, and informing conservation actions.

Potential analogues are provided by the recent geological past but, until recently, many sea level reconstructions have been limited to millennial scale interpretations due to age uncertainties and paucity in proxy derived records. Here we present a sea level history for the tectonically stable "far-field" Great Barrier Reef, Australia, derived from 94 high precision uranium-thorium dates of sub-fossil coral microatolls. Our results provide evidence for at least two periods of relative sea level instability during the Holocene. These sea level oscillations are broadly synchronous with Indo-Pacific negative sea surface temperature anomalies, rapid global cooling events and glacial advances.

Differential response to abiotic stress controls species distributions at biogeographic transition zones	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							CORAL-REEFS; HIGH-LATITUDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS; TEMPERATURE STRESS; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; RANGE EXPANSION; BETA DIVERSITY; HERVEY BAY; GRADIENTS	Understanding range limits is critical to predicting species responses to climate change. Subtropical environments, where many species overlap at their range margins, are cooler, more light-limited and variable than tropical environments. It is thus likely that species respond variably to these multi-stressor regimes and that factors other than mean climatic conditions drive biodiversity patterns. Here, we tested these hypotheses for scleractinian corals at their high-latitude range limits in eastern Australia and investigated the role of mean climatic conditions and of parameters linked to abiotic stress in explaining the distribution and abundance of different groups of species. We found that environmental drivers varied among taxa and were predominantly linked to abiotic stress. The distribution and abundance of tropical species and gradients in species richness (alpha diversity) and turnover (beta diversity) were best explained by light limitation, whereas minimum temperatures and temperature fluctuations best explained gradients in subtropical species, species nestedness and functional diversity. Variation in community structure (considering species composition and abundance) was most closely linked to the combined thermal and light regime. Our study demonstrates the role of abiotic stress in controlling the distribution of species towards their high-latitude range limits and suggests that, at biogeographic transition zones, robust predictions of the impacts of climate change require approaches that account for various aspects of physiological stress and for species abundances and characteristics. These findings support the hypothesis that abiotic stress controls high-latitude range limits and caution that projections solely based on mean temperature could underestimate species' vulnerabilities to climate change.

Managing consequences of climate-driven species redistribution requires integration of ecology, conservation and social science	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS			English	Review						adaptive conservation; climate change; food security; health; managed relocation; range shift; sustainable development; temperature	NO-ANALOG COMMUNITIES; RANGE SHIFTS; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; PROTECTED AREAS; FOOD SECURITY; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; SCIENTIFIC-KNOWLEDGE; IMPROVE PREDICTIONS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; DISTRIBUTION MODELS	Climate change is driving a pervasive global redistribution of the planet's species. Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems, conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology, the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate changing population connectivity and advance adaptation to climate change. Species redistributions present challenges for human well-being, environmental management and sustainable development. By synthesising recent approaches, theories and tools, our review establishes an interdisciplinary foundation for the development of future research on species redistribution. Specifically, we demonstrate how ecological, conservation and social research on species redistribution can best be achieved by working across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions to climate change challenges. Future studies should therefore integrate existing and complementary scientific frameworks while incorporating social science and human-centred approaches. Finally, we emphasise that the best science will not be useful unless more scientists engage with managers, policy makers and the public to develop responsible and socially acceptable options for the global challenges arising from species redistributions.

Spatial and temporal patterns of mass bleaching of corals in the Anthropocene	SCIENCE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; REEF; RECOVERY; IMPACTS; STRESS; GROWTH; TRENDS	Tropical reef systems are transitioning to a new era in which the interval between recurrent bouts of coral bleaching is too short for a full recovery of mature assemblages. We analyzed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed reef locations from 1980 to 2016. The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only 6 years. As global warming has progressed, tropical sea surface temperatures are warmer now during current La Nina conditions than they were during El Nino events three decades ago. Consequently, as we transition to the Anthropocene, coral bleaching is occurring more frequently in all El Nino-Southern Oscillation phases, increasing the likelihood of annual bleaching in the coming decades.

Historical spatial reconstruction of a spawning-aggregation fishery	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						commercial fishing; fishing power; fish-spawning aggregation; historical ecology; shifting baselines; spatial reconstruction; Spanish mackerel	ABUNDANCE; MARINE	Aggregations of individual animals that form for breeding purposes are a critical ecological process for many species, yet these aggregations are inherently vulnerable to exploitation. Studies of the decline of exploited populations that form breeding aggregations tend to focus on catch rate and thus often overlook reductions in geographic range. We tested the hypothesis that catch rate and site occupancy of exploited fish-spawning aggregations (FSAs) decline in synchrony over time. We used the Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) spawning-aggregation fishery in the Great Barrier Reef as a case study. Data were compiled from historical newspaper archives, fisher knowledge, and contemporary fishery logbooks to reconstruct catch rates and exploitation trends from the inception of the fishery. Our fine-scale analysis of catch and effort data spanned 103 years (1911-2013) and revealed a spatial expansion of fishing effort. Effort shifted offshore at a rate of 9.4 nm/decade, and 2.9 newly targeted FSAs were reported/decade. Spatial expansion of effort masked the sequential exploitation, commercial extinction, and loss of 70% of exploited FSAs. After standardizing for improvements in technological innovations, average catch rates declined by 90.5% from 1934 to 2011 (from 119.4 to 11.41 fish/vessel/trip). Mean catch rate of Spanish mackerel and occupancy of exploited mackerel FSAs were not significantly related. Our study revealed a special kind of shifting spatial baseline in which a contraction in exploited FSAs occurred undetected. Knowledge of temporally and spatially explicit information on FSAs can be relevant for the conservation and management of FSA species.

Porites coral response to an oceanographic and human impact gradient in the Line Islands	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; ENERGY ALLOCATION; THERMAL HISTORY; GROWTH-RATES; BASE-LINES; OCEAN; SCALE; STRESS; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Coral bleaching caused by heat stress (warm water) will arguably be the greatest driver of coral reef loss in the coming decades. Understanding how corals have adapted to distinct oceanographic regimes on multiple scales can provide insight into future tolerance and persistence, information critical to directed intervention or targeted protections. The northern Line Islands span a gradient in oceanographic regimes across latitudes, with seawater becoming warmer, fresher, more oligotrophic, and more saturated with aragonite away from the equator. The combination of this regional gradient and island-scale (local) conditions was used as a natural experiment against which to test how massive Porites corals respond to these background conditions and episodic heat stress. We found that coral condition, represented by a metric combining tissue thickness, lipids, and calcification, was similar at almost all islands, though there were differences in how corals allocate resources among these biological parameters. Corals at Teraina, the most densely inhabited island, showed evidence for reduced calcification, potentially associated with human impacts and/or outflow of freshwater from the island. In contrast, Porites corals at Palmyra, a wildlife reserve, exhibited unexpectedly high tissue-condition metrics for its latitude, suggesting an additional food source, possibly plankton-rich lagoonal outflow. We did not find a strong relationship between human habitation and the response of Porites corals to recent heat stress. However, differences in coral calcification rates and energy stores between observed values and those expected based solely on the regional oceanographic gradient, suggests local effects have indirect impacts on these corals.

U-Th dating reveals regional-scale decline of branching Acropora corals on the Great Barrier Reef over the past century	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						U-Th dating; Acropora; coral; mortality; Great Barrier Reef	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; MORTALITY EVENTS; MODERN PORITES; REGIME SHIFTS; PHASE-SHIFTS; BASE-LINES; RESILIENCE; RECOVERY	Hard coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is on a trajectory of decline. However, little is known about past coral mortality before the advent of long-term monitoring (circa 1980s). Using paleoecological analysis and high-precision uranium-thorium (U-Th) dating, we reveal an extensive loss of branching Acropora corals and changes in coral community structure in the Palm Islands region of the central GBR over the past century. In 2008, dead coral assemblages were dominated by large, branching Acropora and living coral assemblages by genera typically found in turbid inshore environments. The timing of Acropora mortality was found to be occasionally synchronous among reefs and frequently linked to discrete disturbance events, occurring in the 1920s to 1960s and again in the 1980s to 1990s. Surveys conducted in 2014 revealed low Acropora cover (<5%) across all sites, with very little evidence of change for up to 60 y at some sites. Collectively, our results suggest a loss of resilience of this formerly dominant key framework builder at a regional scale, with recovery severely lagging behind predictions. Our study implies that the management of these reefs may be predicated on a shifted baseline.

Occurrence data of tropical reef corals may provide new proxies of low latitude sea-surface temperatures. Using modern reef coral distributions we developed a geographically explicit model of sea surface temperatures. Applying this model to coral occurrence data of the LIG provides a latitudinal U-shaped pattern of temperature anomalies with cooler than modern temperatures around the equator and warmer subtropical climes. Our results agree with previously published estimates of LIG temperatures and suggest a poleward broadening of the habitable zone for reef corals during the LIG.

Ghost reefs: Nautical charts document large spatial scale of coral reef loss over 240 years	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							LONG-TERM DECLINE; FLORIDA BAY; AERIAL-PHOTOGRAPHY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WEST-INDIES; POPULATION; MORTALITY; RECOVERY; BARBADOS; SEAGRASS	Massive declines in population abundances of marine animals have been documented over century-long time scales. However, analogous loss of spatial extent of habitat-forming organisms is less well known because georeferenced data are rare over long time scales, particularly in subtidal, tropical marine regions. We use high-resolution historical nautical charts to quantify changes to benthic structure over 240 years in the Florida Keys, finding an overall loss of 52% (SE, 6.4%) of the area of the seafloor occupied by corals. We find a strong spatial dimension to this decline; the spatial extent of coral in Florida Bay and nearshore declined by 87.5% (SE, 7.2%) and 68.8% (SE, 7.5%), respectively, whereas that of offshore areas of coral remained largely intact. These estimates add to finer-scale loss in live coral cover exceeding 90% in some locations in recent decades. The near-complete elimination of the spatial coverage of nearshore coral represents an underappreciated spatial component of the shifting baseline syndrome, with important lessons for other species and ecosystems. That is, modern surveys are typically designed to assess change only within the species' known, extant range. For species ranging from corals to sea turtles, this approach may overlook spatial loss over longer time frames, resulting in both overly optimistic views of their current conservation status and underestimates of their restoration potential.

Local and regional controls of phylogenetic structure at the high-latitude range limits of corals	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						range limit; phylogenetic structure; niche conservatism; environmental filtering; coral; trait	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NICHE CONSERVATISM; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; DETERMINANTS; RELATEDNESS; EVOLUTION	Understanding how range-edge populations will respond to climate change is an urgent research priority. Here, we used a phylogenetic community ecology approach to examine how ecological and evolutionary processes shape biodiversity patterns of scleractinian corals at their high-latitude range limits in eastern Australia. We estimated phylogenetic signal in seven ecologically important functional traits and conducted tests of phylogenetic structure at local and regional scales using the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon indices (NTI) for the presence/absence and abundance data. Regional tests showed light phylogenetic clustering, indicating that coral species found in this subtropical-to-temperate transition zone are more closely related to each other than are species on the nearby, more northerly Great Barrier Reef. Local tests revealed variable patterns of phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion and higher than expected phylogenetic turnover among sites. In combination, these results are broadly consistent with the hierarchical filtering model, whereby species pass through a regional climatic filter based on their tolerances for marginal conditions and subsequently segregate into local assemblages according to the relative strength of habitat filtering and species interactions. Conservatism of tested traits suggests that corals will likely track their niches with climate change. Nevertheless, high turnover of lineages among sites indicates that range shifts will probably vary among species and highlights the vulnerability and conservation significance of high-latitude reefs.

Popular media records reveal multi-decadal trends in recreational fishing catch rates	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HISTORICAL DECLINES; AUSTRALIA; FISHERIES; IMPACTS; DEGRADATION; MANAGEMENT; ESTUARIES; FLORIDA	Despite threats to human wellbeing from ecological degradation, public engagement with this issue remains at low levels. However, studies have shown that crafting messages to resonate with people's personal experiences can enhance engagement. Recreational fishing is one of the principal ways in which people interact with aquatic environments, but long-term data from this perspective are considered rare. We uncovered 852 popular media records of recreational fishing for an Australian estuary across a 140-year period. Using information contained in these articles we analysed the species composition of recreational catches over time and constructed two distinct time series of catch and effort (n fish fisher(-1) trip(-1); kg fish fisher(-1) trip(-1)) for recreational fishing trips and fishing club competitions (mean n and kg fish caught across all competitors, and n and kg fish caught by the competition winner). Reported species composition remained similar over time. Catch rates reported from recreational fishing trips (1900-1998) displayed a significant decline, averaging 32.5 fish fisher(-1) trip(-1) prior to 1960, and 18.8 fish fisher(-1) trip(-1) post-1960. Mean n fish fisher(-1) competition(-1) (1913-1983) also significantly declined, but best n fish fisher(-1) competition(-1) (1925-1980) displayed no significant change, averaging 31.2 fish fisher(-1) competition(-1) over the time series. Mean and best kg fish fisher(-1) competition(-1) trends also displayed no significant change, averaging 4.2 and 9.9 kg fisher(-1) competition(-1), respectively. These variable trends suggest that while some fishers experienced diminishing returns in this region over the last few decades, the most skilled inshore fishers were able to maintain their catch rates, highlighting the difficulties inherent in crafting conservation messages that will resonate with all sections of a community. Despite these challenges, this research demonstrates that popular media sources can provide multiple long-term trends at spatial scales, in units and via a recreational experience that many people can relate to.

Identifying patterns and drivers of coral diversity in the Central Indo-Pacific marine biodiversity hotspot	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Review							FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; EAST KALIMANTAN; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; CARBONATE PLATFORMS; SPECIES RICHNESS; REEF CORALS; PATCH REEF; SE ASIA; TELL US; HISTORY	Biodiversity hotspots are increasingly recognized as areas of high taxonomic and functional diversity. These hotspots are dynamic and shift geographically over time in response to environmental change. To identify drivers of the origin, evolution, and persistence of diversity hotspots, we investigated the diversity patterns of reef-building corals (Scleractinia) in the Central Indo-Pacific, a marine biodiversity hotspot for the last 25 Myr. We used the scleractinian fossil record (based on literature and a newly acquired fossil collection) to examine the taxonomic and functional diversity of corals from the Eocene to Pliocene. Our data identify potential drivers of coral diversity through time (and space) in the Central Indo-Pacific by constraining the timing of taxonomic turnover events and correlating them with known environmental changes. Increases in taxonomic diversity, high origination rates, and changes in abundance of functional character states indicate that the origin of the Central Indo-Pacific hotspot occurred during the Oligocene, initially through proliferation of pre-existing taxa and then by origination of new taxa. In contrast to taxonomic diversity, overall functional diversity of Central Indo-Pacific reef-building corals remained constant from the Eocene to the Pliocene. Our results identify global sea level as a main driver of diversity increase that, together with local tectonics, regulates availability of suitable habitats. Moreover, marine biodiversity hotspots develop from both the accumulation of taxa from older biodiversity hotspots and origination of new taxa. Our study demonstrates the utility of a combined literature-based and new collection approach for gaining new insights into the timing, drivers, and development of tropical biodiversity hotspots.

J.; Mihaljevic, Morana; Pandolfi, John M.; Welsh, Kevin			Unravelling the depositional origins and diagenetic alteration of carbonate breccias	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY			English	Article						Cenozoic carbonate platform; Carbonate slope brecda; Diagenesis; Fades; SE Asia; Batu Gading Limestone	RESERVOIR QUALITY; PLATFORM-MARGIN; SKELETAL CARBONATES; CENOZOIC CARBONATES; NORTH-SEA; FAULT; SEQUENCE; ASIA; STRATIGRAPHY; CEMENTATION	Carbonate breccias dissociated from their platform top counterparts are little studied despite their potential to reveal the nature of past shallow-water carbonate systems and the sequential alteration of such systems. A petrographic and stable isotopic study allowed evaluation of the sedimentological and diagenetic variability of the Cenozoic Batu Gading Limestone breccia of Borneo. Sixteen lithofacies representing six facies groups have been identified mainly from the breccia clasts on the basis of shared textural and compositional features. Clasts of the breccia are representative of shallow carbonate platform top and associated flank to basinal deposits. Dominant inputs are from rocky (karstic) shorelines or localised seagrass environments, coral patch reef and larger foraminiferal-rich deposits. Early, pre-brecciation alteration (including micritisation, rare dissolution of bioclasts, minor syntaxial overgrowth cementation, pervasive neomorphism and calcitisation of bioclasts and matrix) was mainly associated with marine fluids in a near surface to shallow burial environment. The final stages of pre-brecciation diagenesis include mechanical compaction and cementation of open porosity in a shallow to moderate depth burial environment. Post-brecciation diagenesis took place at increasingly moderate to deep burial depths under the influence of dominantly marine burial fluids. Extensive compaction, circum-clast dissolution seams and stylolites have resulted in a tightly fitted breccia fabric, with some development of fractures and calcite cements. A degree of fades-specific controls are evident for the pre-brecciation diagenesis. Pervasive mineralogical stabilisation and cementation have, however, led to a broad similarity of diagenetic features in the breccia clasts thereby effectively preserving depositional features of near-original platform top and margin environments. There is little intra-clast alteration overprint associated with subsequent clast reworking and post-brecciation diagenesis. The diagenetic-, and to an extent depositional- and clast-characteristics of the Batu Gading deposits are diagnostic of breccia origins. The predominance of: early and pervasive stabilisation of calcitic components, pervasive compaction resulting in a fitted texture, and paucity of meteoric dissolution or cementation effects are collectively all indicators of slope deposition and lithification. These features are comparable with other regional and global examples of submarine slope breccias, and in particular those also from syntectonic settings (Wannier, 2009). The results of this study, along with regional analogues, suggest the potential for reworked carbonate debris in slope settings to be a viable way of investigating carbonate platform variability and their subsequent alteration in the absence of preserved platform top or margin deposits.

Purpose, policy, and practice: Intent and reality for on-ground management and outcomes of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Marine protected area; Marine environmental policy; Policy implementation; Great Barrier Reef; International agreements; Cumulative impacts	PROTECTED AREAS; GOVERNANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; IMPACTS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; INTEGRATION; RESERVES; COASTAL; WORK	Notwithstanding a complex array of international, national, and local policies designed to protect biodiversity and manage human activities, the condition of Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been deteriorating. This trend indicates that policy settings are inadequate or the right policies have been prescribed but not effectively implemented. This study aimed to determine which policies influenced on-ground management of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and Marine Park, how they were implemented, and the challenges encountered by practitioners in applying policies. The research required content analysis of policy instruments relevant to various jurisdictional levels, and surveys and interviews with 19 key informants across jurisdictions and agencies. This study found that policy intent is not automatically translated into practice: international agreements are interpreted and reinterpreted along the policy pathway to on-ground management and, consequently, the aspirations of these agreements can be frustrated and their effectiveness diluted. Due to limits of jurisdictional responsibility, practitioners within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are constrained in influencing key factors that impact on their capacity to address threats and manage outcomes. The major policy gap affecting management outcomes was the absence of a mechanism with which to manage cumulative impacts responsible for deterioration of key ecosystem processes and biodiversity. These findings highlight that effective policy implementation is a challenging task, limited by gaps between intentions and outcomes, inconsistencies, and conflicting agendas. An improved understanding of the policy implementation process and the policy-practitioner relationship is essential to enhancing links between policy and on-ground management.

Biodiversity redistribution under climate change: Impacts on ecosystems and human well-being	SCIENCE			English	Review							RANGE SHIFTS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; EXTINCTION RISK; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; ARCTIC VEGETATION; FISH COMMUNITIES; NORTH-AMERICAN; FOOD SECURITY; RESPONSES; MALARIA	Distributions of Earth's species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.

Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are crucial marine calcifiers that rely on photo-endosymbionts for growth and calcification, yet the influence of environmental conditions in shaping their interactions with prokaryotic and eukaryotic associates is poorly known. Results: Here, we used next-generation sequencing to identify eukaryotic photosynthesizing and prokaryotic microbes associated with the common LBF Amphistegina lobifera across a physio-chemical gradient on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We collected samples from three reef sites located in the inner-, mid-and outer-shelf regions of the northern section of the GBR. Results showed the consistent presence of Bacillaryophyta as the main eukaryotic taxa associated with A. lobifera across all reef sites analysed; however, the abundance and the diversity of prokaryotic organisms varied among reef sites. Inner-shelf specimens showed the highest diversity of prokaryote associates, with a total of 231 genotypes in their core microbiome. A total of 30 taxa were identified in the core microbiome across all reef sites. Within these taxa, Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria present. The presence of groups such as Actinobacteria was significantly correlated with inner-shelf populations, whereas the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was associated with A. lobifera collected from mid-and outer-shelf reef sites. Conclusions: We found that benthic foraminifera form stable and persistent symbiosis with eukaryotic partners, but flexible and site-specific associations with prokaryotic microbes that likely influence the ecological success of these crucial calcifying organisms on the GBR.

Variation in sensitivity of large benthic Foraminifera to the combined effects of ocean warming and local impacts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRIMORPHIC LIFE-CYCLE; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; TERRESTRIAL RUNOFF; WATER-QUALITY; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; ISLAND	Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are crucial marine calcifiers in coral reefs, and sensitive to environmental changes. Yet, many species successfully colonise a wide range of habitats including highly fluctuating environments. We tested the combined effects of ocean warming, local impacts and different light levels on populations of the common LBF Amphistegina lobifera collected along a cross-shelf gradient of temperature and nutrients fluctuations. We analysed survivorship, bleaching frequency, chlorophyll a content and fecundity. Elevated temperature and nitrate significantly reduced survivorship and fecundity of A. lobifera across populations studied. This pattern was exacerbated when combined with below optimum light levels. Inshore populations showed a consistent resistance to increased temperature and nitrate levels, but all populations studied were significantly affected by light reduction. These findings demonstrated the capacity of some populations of LBF to acclimate to local conditions; nonetheless improvements in local water quality can ultimately ameliorate effects of climate change in local LBF populations.

Global warming and recurrent mass bleaching of corals	NATURE			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RECOVERY; RESILIENCE; MORTALITY; IMPACTS; TRENDS; SPACE	During 2015-2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

Shifts in species abundance of large benthic foraminifera Amphistegina: the possible effects of Tropical Cyclone Ita	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Great Barrier Reef; Symbiont-bearing foraminifera; Depth distribution; Community structure	CORAL-REEFS; DISTURBANCE; GRADIENTS	On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the large benthic foraminifera Amphistegina lobifera, A. lessonii and A. radiata occur in shallow (< 30 m) areas and have a clear distribution gradient. In April 2014, Severe Tropical Cyclone (TC) Ita impacted the northern region of the GBR. We surveyed the leeward slope of Yonge Reef at 6 and 18 m, in August 2013 and 2014. Results showed an overall decline in abundance of Amphistegina and a shift in proportion at both depths between 2013 and 2014. The shallow-dweller A. lobifera was severely affected; however, the deep-dweller A. radiata and the generalist A. lessonii only declined at 6 m and increased in abundance at 18 m. Patterns observed are likely linked to the occurrence of TC Ita. We propose that differing population-level source-sink dynamics should be considered when exploring persistence and recovery patterns over depth in foraminiferal communities.

While the effects on community structure are evident in the fossil record, demographic consequences for populations of individual species are harder to evaluate because fossils reveal relative, but not absolute, abundances. However, genomic analyses of living species that have survived a mass extinction event offer the potential for understanding the demographic effects of such environmental fluctuations on extant species. Here, we show how environmental variation since the Pliocene has shaped demographic changes in extant corals of the genus Orbicella, major extant reef builders in the Caribbean that today are endangered. We use genomic approaches to estimate previously unknown current and past population sizes over the last 3 million years. Populations of all three Orbicella declined around 2-1 million years ago, coincident with the extinction of at least 50% of Caribbean coral species. The estimated changes in population size are consistent across the three species despite their ecological differences. Subsequently, two shallow-water specialists expanded their population sizes at least 2-fold, over a time that overlaps with the disappearance of their sister competitor species O. nancyi (the organ-pipe Orbicella). Our study suggests that populations of Orbicella species are capable of rebounding from reductions in population size under suitable conditions and that the effective population size of modern corals provides rich standing genetic variation for corals to adapt to climate change. For conservation genetics, our study suggests the need to evaluate genetic variation under appropriate demographic models.

The broad footprint of climate change from genes to biomes to people	SCIENCE			English	Review							DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION; BODY-SIZE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GROWING-SEASON; WARMING FAVORS; CHANGE IMPACTS; RANGE SHIFTS; TEMPERATURE; MARINE	Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.

Effects of Elevated Temperature on the Shell Density of the Large Benthic Foraminifera Amphistegina lobifera	JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						acclimation; enzyme activity; Great Barrier Reef; Mg-ATPase; size	BIOMINERALIZATION; MG2+; CALCIFICATION; HOMEOSTASIS; RESPONSES; GIBBOSA; ATPASES; RATIOS; CARBON; REEFS	This study investigated the effects of elevated temperature on shell density and Mg-ATPase activity of Amphistegina lobifera. This species is abundant in shallow reef habitats, and can be vulnerable to daily physicochemical fluctuations. To assess potential responses and acclimation mechanisms of A. lobifera to changing temperature conditions, we performed a blocked-design experiment exposing specimens collected from different reef sites (inshore and offshore) to three temperature treatments (Control: 24 degrees C, + 2 degrees C: 26 degrees C and + 5 degrees C: 29 degrees C) for 30 days. The final size and shell density of inshore reef foraminifera were unaffected by elevated temperature, and the enzyme activity in these individuals showed that they were able to acclimate to new temperature conditions. In contrast, offshore A. lobifera were more sensitive to changes in temperature, and heat stress caused growth impairment and inhibited Mg-ATPase activity. However, newly added chambers were not affected. These results suggested that Mg-ATPase plays an important role in regulating intracellular Mg2+ ions, but has little influence in the onset of calcification in A. lobifera. Moreover, it suggests that even though A. lobifera can regulate intracellular functions, local habitat seems to play a crucial role in determining how foraminifera respond to environmental changes.

Evidence of reduced mid-Holocene ENSO variance on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						coral luminescence; ENSO; mid-Holocene; paleoclimate; wavelet; Great Barrier Reef	DECLINING CORAL CALCIFICATION; EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; EL-NINO EVOLUTION; MASSIVE PORITES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; FLUORESCENT BANDS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; LUMINESCENT LINES; MORTALITY EVENTS	Globally, coral reefs are under increasing pressure both through direct anthropogenic influence and increases in climate extremes. Understanding past climate dynamics that negatively affected coral reef growth is imperative for both improving management strategies and for modeling coral reef responses to a changing climate. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary source of climate variability at interannual timescales on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), northeastern Australia. Applying continuous wavelet transforms to visually assessed coral luminescence intensity in massive Porites corals from the central GBR we demonstrate that these records reliably reproduce ENSO variance patterns for the period 1880-1985. We then applied this method to three subfossil corals from the same reef to reconstruct ENSO variance from similar to 5200 to 4300years before present (yBP). We show that ENSO events were less extreme and less frequent after similar to 5200yBP on the GBR compared to modern records. Growth characteristics of the corals are consistent with cooler sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 5200 and 4300yBP compared to both the millennia prior (similar to 6000yBP) and modern records.

Holocene sea level instability in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia: high-precision U-Th dating of fossil microatolls	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Sea level; Holocene; Great Barrier Reef; Microatoll; Uranium-thorium; Reef hiatus	INITIAL TH-230/TH-232; NORTH QUEENSLAND; MORTALITY EVENTS; MODERN PORITES; MID-HOLOCENE; MORETON BAY; CORAL-REEFS; TURN-OFF; CLIMATE; GROWTH	Three emergent subfossil reef flats from the inshore Keppel Islands, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, were used to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL). Forty-two high-precision uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates obtained from coral microatolls and coral colonies (2 sigma age errors from +/- 8 to 37 yr) in conjunction with elevation surveys provide evidence in support of a nonlinear RSL regression throughout the Holocene. RSL was as least 0.75 m above present from similar to 6500 to 5500 yr before present (yr BP; where "present" is 1950). Following this highstand, two sites indicated a coeval lowering of RSL of at least 0.4 m from 5500 to 5300 yr BP which was maintained for similar to 200 yr. After the lowstand, RSL returned to higher levels before a 2000-yr hiatus in reef flat corals after 4600 yr BP at all three sites. A second possible RSL lowering event of similar to 0.3 m from similar to 2800 to 1600 yr BP was detected before RSL stabilised similar to 0.2 m above present levels by 900 yr BP. While the mechanism of the RSL instability is still uncertain, the alignment with previously reported RSL oscillations, rapid global climate changes and mid-Holocene reef "turn-off" on the GBR are discussed.

A Trait-Based Approach to Advance Coral Reef Science	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORRELATED EVOLUTION; BODY-SIZE; ECOLOGY; PHYLOGENIES; RESILIENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; RESPONSES; SERVICES; GROWTH	Coral reefs are biologically diverse and ecologically complex ecosystems constructed by stony corals. Despite decades of research, basic coral population biology and community ecology questions remain. Quantifying trait variation among species can help resolve these questions, but progress has been hampered by a paucity of trait data for the many, often rare, species and by a reliance on nonquantitative approaches. Therefore, we propose filling data gaps by prioritizing traits that are easy to measure, estimating key traits for species with missing data, and identifying 'supertraits' that capture a large amount of variation for a range of biological and ecological processes. Such an approach can accelerate our understanding of coral ecology and our ability to protect critically threatened global ecosystems.

Changing light levels induce photo-oxidative stress and alterations in shell density of Amphistegina lobifera (Foraminifera)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Acclimation; Irradiance; CT scan; Antioxidant capacity; Foraminifera; Coral reef	SYMBIONT-BEARING FORAMINIFERA; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; LARGE BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; LARGER FORAMINIFERA; SEDIMENT PRODUCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; WATER-QUALITY; CORAL; TEMPERATURE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Light is an important factor limiting the distribution of holobiont (host-algae) organisms in marine environments. Reef-dwelling large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are particularly sensitive to changes in light exposure, but their cryptic behaviour allows them to colonise different habitats across a light gradient. Yet, how foraminifera of the same species that live in different habitats respond to variations in light conditions, and the physiological and morphological attributes that govern that response, remain unclear. Here, we investigate how Amphistegina lobifera, a common and abundant LBF species in reef environments, collected from different reef sites across a light gradient, respond to changing light levels under lab-controlled conditions. Reduced light below their optimum level for growth and calcification caused a significant reduction in antioxidant capacity, and a significant decline in the density of newly added chambers. In contrast, elevated light caused significant reduction in survivorship, induced bleaching and photo-oxidative stress, and caused thickening of external chambers. Reef site did not have a significant effect on most of the responses, and populations collected from different reef sites showed similar sensitivity to changes in irradiance below and above their optimum level. The capacity to regulate symbiont density and to host a diversity of symbiotic diatoms within Amphistegina could be a reason for their ability to acclimate rapidly to different light levels. However, prolonged exposure to reduced light may result in a decrease in shell density and, as a consequence, a decline in carbonate production in reef environments.

We seek to leverage these existing measures to create a hybrid measure of esophageal illness HRQOL (the Northwestern Esophageal Quality of Life-NEQOL), allowing for broad use across diseases while maintaining sensitivity to nuances of a specific condition. METHODS: A three-step, mixed-methods process per FDA guidelines for patient-reported outcome (PRO) development was followed: review and consolidation of existing HRQOL measure items into a single questionnaire, reliability and validity analyses (principle components factor analysis, Cronbach alpha, Guttman split-half, inter-item correlation, test-retest correlation, and Pearson's correlation with related constructs) based on responses from a representative sample of esophageal illness patients, and individual structured cognitive interviews with patients for item refinement and reduction. RESULTS: An initial 30-item measure was created. Two-hundred twelve patients completed the reliability and validity portion of the study, and 15 completed cognitive interviews. Factor analysis and item-reduction resulted in 11 items being removed from the NEQOL prior to patient interviews. Construct validity was supported by moderate and significant correlations with psychological distress and general HRQOL. Test-retest reliability was excellent. Following patient interviews, an additional 5 items were removed because of floor effects or participant feedback yielding a 14-item, single scale measure of HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Although more research is warranted, the NEQOL is a reliable and a valid hybrid measure of disease-specific HRQOL across several chronic esophageal conditions.

Ecological and methodological drivers of species' distribution and phenology responses to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						fishing; global warming; marine ecosystem; meta-analysis; publication bias; range edge; range shift; season; time series; tropics	RANGE SHIFTS; MARINE; VELOCITY; IMPACTS	Climate change is shifting species' distribution and phenology. Ecological traits, such as mobility or reproductive mode, explain variation in observed rates of shift for some taxa. However, estimates of relationships between traits and climate responses could be influenced by how responses are measured. We compiled a global data set of 651 published marine species' responses to climate change, from 47 papers on distribution shifts and 32 papers on phenology change. We assessed the relative importance of two classes of predictors of the rate of change, ecological traits of the responding taxa and methodological approaches for quantifying biological responses. Methodological differences explained 22% of the variation in range shifts, more than the 7.8% of the variation explained by ecological traits. For phenology change, methodological approaches accounted for 4% of the variation in measurements, whereas 8% of the variation was explained by ecological traits. Our ability to predict responses from traits was hindered by poor representation of species from the tropics, where temperature isotherms are moving most rapidly. Thus, the mean rate of distribution change may be underestimated by this and other global syntheses. Our analyses indicate that methodological approaches should be explicitly considered when designing, analysing and comparing results among studies. To improve climate impact studies, we recommend that (1) reanalyses of existing time series state how the existing data sets may limit the inferences about possible climate responses; (2) qualitative comparisons of species' responses across different studies be limited to studies with similar methodological approaches; (3) meta-analyses of climate responses include methodological attributes as covariates; and (4) that new time series be designed to include the detection of early warnings of change or ecologically relevant change. Greater consideration of methodological attributes will improve the accuracy of analyses that seek to quantify the role of climate change in species' distribution and phenology changes.

SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; ACROPORA; NEOGENE; ASSEMBLAGES; EVOLUTION; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY	As one of the most prolific and widespread reef builders, the staghorn coral Acropora holds a disproportionately large role in how coral reefs will respond to accelerating anthropogenic change. We show that although Acropora has a diverse history extended over the past 50 million years, it was not a dominant reef builder until the onset of high-amplitude glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations 1.8 million years ago. High growth rates and propagation by fragmentation have favored staghorn corals since this time. In contrast, staghorn corals are among the most vulnerable corals to anthropogenic stressors, with marked global loss of abundance worldwide. The continued decline in staghorn coral abundance and the mounting challenges from both local stress and climate change will limit the coral reefs' ability to provide ecosystem services.

The Coral Trait Database, a curated database of trait information for coral species from the global oceans	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							REEF-BUILDING CORALS; GALAPAGOS-ISLANDS ECUADOR; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; POCILLOPORA-DAMICORNIS LINNAEUS; CNIDARIA ANTHOZOA SCLERACTINIA; GROWTH-RATES INDICATE; ACROPORA-ASPERA DANA; PACIFIC COSTA-RICA; EASTERN PACIFIC; MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS	Trait-based approaches advance ecological and evolutionary research because traits provide a strong link to an organism's function and fitness. Trait-based research might lead to a deeper understanding of the functions of, and services provided by, ecosystems, thereby improving management, which is vital in the current era of rapid environmental change. Coral reef scientists have long collected trait data for corals; however, these are difficult to access and often under-utilized in addressing large-scale questions. We present the Coral Trait Database initiative that aims to bring together physiological, morphological, ecological, phylogenetic and biogeographic trait information into a single repository. The database houses species-and individual-level data from published field and experimental studies alongside contextual data that provide important framing for analyses. In this data descriptor, we release data for 56 traits for 1547 species, and present a collaborative platform on which other trait data are being actively federated. Our overall goal is for the Coral Trait Database to become an open-source, community-led data clearinghouse that accelerates coral reef research.

Setting the Record Straight: Assessing the Reliability of Retrospective Accounts of Change	CONSERVATION LETTERS			English	Article						Australian fisheries; historical ecology; local ecological knowledge; marine conservation; shifting baselines	LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; BASE-LINE SYNDROME; FISHERS; GULF; INTERVIEWS; ANECDOTES; MEMORY; TRENDS	Ecological degradation is accelerating, reducing our ability to detect and reverse declines. Resource user accounts have the potential to provide critical information on past change but their reliability can rarely be tested, hence they are often perceived as less valid than other forms of scientific data. We compared individual fishers' catch records, recorded 1-50 years ago, with their memories of past good, typical and poor catches for the corresponding time period. Good and poor catches were recalled with reasonable accuracy, matching variability in recorded catch with no significant change observed over time. Typical recalled catches were overestimated and became significantly more exaggerated over time, but were more comparable to mean than median recorded values. While accuracy of resource users' memory varied with the type of information recalled, our results suggest that carefully structured interview questions can produce reliable quantitative data to inform resource management, even after several decades have elapsed.

Nineteenth century narratives reveal historic catch rates for Australian snapper (Pagrus auratus)	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article						Catch per unit effort; historical ecology; multiple imputation; narrative accounts; qualitative data	BASE-LINES; ECOLOGY; DECLINE; BIOMASS; GULF	Snapper (Pagrus auratus) is widely distributed throughout subtropical and temperate southern oceans and forms a significant recreational and commercial fishery in Queensland, Australia. Using data from government reports, media sources, popular publications and a government fisheries survey carried out in 1910, we compiled information on individual snapper fishing trips that took place prior to the commencement of fisherywide organized data collection, from 1871 to 1939. In addition to extracting all available quantitative data, we translated qualitative information into bounded estimates and used multiple imputation to handle missing values, forming 287 records for which catch rate (snapperfisher(-1)h(-1)) could be derived. Uncertainty was handled through a parametric maximum likelihood framework (a transformed trivariate Gaussian), which facilitated statistical comparisons between data sources. No statistically significant differences in catch rates were found among media sources and the government fisheries survey. Catch rates remained stable throughout the time series, averaging 3.75snapperfisher(-1)h(-1) (95% confidence interval, 3.42-4.09) as the fishery expanded into new grounds. In comparison, a contemporary (1993-2002) south-east Queensland charter fishery produced an average catch rate of 0.4snapperfisher(-1)h(-1) (95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.58). These data illustrate the productivity of a fishery during its earliest years of development and represent the earliest catch rate data globally for this species. By adopting a formalized approach to address issues common to many historical records - missing data, a lack of quantitative information and reporting bias - our analysis demonstrates the potential for historical narratives to contribute to contemporary fisheries management.

Influence of local habitat on the physiological responses of large benthic foraminifera to temperature and nutrient stress	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SYMBIONT-BEARING FORAMINIFERA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; GROWTH; CALCIFICATION; ADAPTATION; PHOSPHORUS; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS	Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are important for reef sediment formation, but sensitive to elevated temperature and nutrients. However, it is possible that conspecific foraminifera living in different reef sites present divergent response to environmental shifts. We investigated how populations of Amphistegina lobifera from reef sites located along a temperature and nutrient gradient of the northern Great Barrier Reef respond and acclimate to elevated temperature and nitrate under lab-controlled conditions. Generalized linear mixed models showed that interaction between reef sites and temperature or nitrate conditions had a significant effect on survivorship, bleaching frequency and growth rates of A. lobifera. Further physiological analyses of antioxidant capacity and Ca-ATPase activity showed that populations collected from the inner-shelf sites (highest nutrient levels, largest temperature variation) were consistently able to acclimate to both parameters after 30 days. In contrast, foraminifera collected from the reef sites located in the mid-and outer-shelfs were significantly more sensitive to elevated temperatures and nitrate. Our results highlight the importance of local habitat in shaping the tolerance of LBF to changing environmental conditions; populations that live in stable environments are more sensitive to elevated temperature and nitrate, even within their fundamental tolerance range, than those that experience fluctuating conditions.

Historical photographs revisited: A case study for dating and characterizing recent loss of coral cover on the inshore Great Barrier Reef	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MORTALITY EVENTS; MODERN PORITES; INNER-SHELF; RECOVERY; VARIABILITY; RECRUITMENT; DISTURBANCE; PRECISION; FUTURE; SHIFTS	Long-term data with high-precision chronology are essential to elucidate past ecological changes on coral reefs beyond the period of modern-day monitoring programs. In 2012 we revisited two inshore reefs within the central Great Barrier Reef, where a series of historical photographs document a loss of hard coral cover between c.1890-1994 AD. Here we use an integrated approach that includes high-precision U-Th dating specifically tailored for determining the age of extremely young corals to provide a robust, objective characterisation of ecological transition. The timing of mortality for most of the dead in situ corals sampled from the historical photograph locations was found to coincide with major flood events in 1990-1991 at Bramston Reef and 1970 and 2008 at Stone Island. Evidence of some recovery was found at Bramston Reef with living coral genera similar to what was described in c.1890 present in 2012. In contrast, very little sign of coral re-establishment was found at Stone Island suggesting delayed recovery.

Climate velocity and the future global redistribution of marine biodiversity	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; RANGE SHIFTS; SCENARIOS; IMPACTS; OCEAN; DISTRIBUTIONS; 21ST-CENTURY; ECOSYSTEMS; TAXA	Anticipating the effect of climate change on biodiversity, in particular on changes in community composition, is crucial for adaptive ecosystem management(1) but remains a critical knowledge gap(2). Here, we use climate velocity trajectories(3), together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways(4) (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies(5,6). We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts(7,8) highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.

Marine extinction risk shaped by trait-environment interactions over 500 million years	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						differential extinction risk; extinction selectivity; geographic range; life habit; mass extinction; mollusk; survivorship	TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY GRADIENTS; CARBON-ISOTOPE EXCURSIONS; MASS EXTINCTION; SELECTIVE EXTINCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOSSIL RECORD; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE; LARVAL ECOLOGY; LATE NEOGENE	Perhaps the most pressing issue in predicting biotic responses to present and future global change is understanding how environmental factors shape the relationship between ecological traits and extinction risk. The fossil record provides millions of years of insight into how extinction selectivity (i.e., differential extinction risk) is shaped by interactions between ecological traits and environmental conditions. Numerous paleontological studies have examined trait-based extinction selectivity; however, the extent to which these patterns are shaped by environmental conditions is poorly understood due to a lack of quantitative synthesis across studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies on fossil marine bivalves and gastropods that span 458 million years to uncover how global environmental and geochemical changes covary with trait-based extinction selectivity. We focused on geographic range size and life habit (i.e., infaunal vs. epifaunal), two of the most important and commonly examined predictors of extinction selectivity. We used geochemical proxies related to global climate, as well as indicators of ocean acidification, to infer average global environmental conditions. Life-habit selectivity is weakly dependent on environmental conditions, with infaunal species relatively buffered from extinction during warmer climate states. In contrast, the odds of taxa with broad geographic ranges surviving an extinction (>2500km for genera, >500km for species) are on average three times greater than narrow-ranging taxa (estimate of odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval=2.3-3.5), regardless of the prevailing global environmental conditions. The environmental independence of geographic range size extinction selectivity emphasizes the critical role of geographic range size in setting conservation priorities.

Filling historical data gaps to foster solutions in marine conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC3)	AUG 14-18, 2014	Glasgow, SCOTLAND			Coastal management; Fisheries; Historical ecology; Marine ecology; Qualitative data	TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; SHIFTING BASE-LINES; CORAL-REEFS; WADDEN SEA; NORTH-SEA; FISH; FISHERIES; EXTINCTION; ABUNDANCE; TARGETS	Ecological data sets rarely extend back more than a few decades, limiting our understanding of environmental change and its drivers. Marine historical ecology has played a critical role in filling these data gaps by illuminating the magnitude and rate of ongoing changes in marine ecosystems. Yet despite a growing body of knowledge, historical insights are rarely explicitly incorporated in mainstream conservation and management efforts. Failing to consider historical change can have major implications for conservation, such as the ratcheting down of expectations of ecosystem quality over time, leading to less ambitious targets for recovery or restoration. We discuss several unconventional sources used by historical ecologists to fill data gaps including menus, newspaper articles, cookbooks, museum collections, artwork, benthic sediment cores and novel techniques for their analysis. We specify opportunities for the integration of historical data into conservation and management, and highlight the important role that these data can play in filling conservation data gaps and motivating conservation actions. As historical marine ecology research continues to grow as a multidisciplinary enterprise, great opportunities remain to foster direct linkages to conservation and improve the outlook for marine ecosystems.

The cumulative impacts of repeated heavy rainfall, flooding and altered Water quality on the high-latitude coral reefs of Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Submarine groundwater discharge; Water quality; High-latitude; Flood plume; Australia; Coral	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; LAGOON; TERRESTRIAL; SEDIMENT; SEAGRASS; MANAGEMENT; SALINITY	Terrestrial runoff and flooding have resulted in major impacts on coral communities worldwide, but we lack detailed understanding of flood plume conditions and their ecological effects. Over the course of repeated flooding between 2010 and 2013, we measured coral cover and water quality on the highlatitude coral reefs of Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia. In 2013, salinity, total suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were altered for up to six months post-flooding. Submarine groundwater caused hypo-saline conditions for a further four months. Despite the greater magnitude of flooding in 2013, declines in coral abundance (similar to 28%) from these floods were lower than the 2011 flood (similar to 40%), which occurred immediately after a decade of severe drought. There was an overall cumulative decrease of coral by similar to 56% from 2010 to 2013. Our study highlights the need for local scale monitoring and research to facilitate informed management and conservation of catchments and marine environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Distribution, abundance and diversity of crustose coralline algae on the Great Barrier Reef	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Coralline algae; Great Barrier Reef; Continental shelf; Benthic community structure; Biodiversity; Coral reefs	WATER-QUALITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MARINE ORGANISMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RHODOPHYTA; COVER; RIDGE; PRODUCTIVITY; HYDROLITHON; SURVIVAL	The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the world's largest coral reef ecosystem. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are important contributors to reef calcium carbonate and can facilitate coral recruitment. Despite the importance of CCA, little is known about species-level distribution, abundance, and diversity, and how these vary across the continental shelf and key habitat zones within the GBR. We quantified CCA species distributions using line transects (n = 127) at 17 sites in the northern and central regions of the GBR, distributed among inner-, mid-, and outer-shelf regions. At each site, we identified CCA along replicate transects in three habitat zones: reef flat, reef crest, and reef slope. Taxonomically, CCA species are challenging to identify (especially in the field), and there is considerable disagreement in approach. We used published, anatomically based taxonomic schemes for consistent identification. We identified 30 CCA species among 12 genera; the most abundant species were Porolithon onkodes, Paragoniolithon conicum (sensu Adey), Neogoniolithon fosliei, and Hydrolithon reinboldii. Significant cross-shelf differences were observed in CCA community structure and CCA abundance, with inner-shelf reefs exhibiting lower CCA abundance than outer-shelf reefs. Shelf position, habitat zone, latitude, depth, and the interaction of shelf position and habitat were all significantly associated with variation in composition of CCA communities. Collectively, shelf position, habitat, and their interaction contributed to 22.6 % of the variation in coralline communities. Compared to mid- and outer-shelf sites, inner-shelf sites exhibited lower relative abundances of N. fosliei and Lithophyllum species. Reef crest habitats exhibited greater abundance of N. fosliei than reef flat and reef slope habitats. Reef slope habitats exhibited lower abundance of P. onkodes, but greater abundance of Neogoniolithon clavycymosum than reef crest and reef slope habitats. These findings provide important data on CCA distribution within the GBR and reinforce the fundamental role of cross-shelf variation and diverse habitat zones as contributors to the biodiversity of the GBR.

Paleontological baselines for evaluating extinction risk in the modern oceans	SCIENCE			English	Article							MARINE BIODIVERSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; HOTSPOTS; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; PREDICTORS; DRIVERS; CLIMATE	Marine taxa are threatened by anthropogenic impacts, but knowledge of their extinction vulnerabilities is limited. The fossil record provides rich information on past extinctions that can help predict biotic responses. We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk-extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models-for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high intrinsic risk are strongly affected by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately in the tropics, raising the possibility that these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Intrinsic risk provides a prehuman baseline for considering current threats to marine biodiversity.

Rapid accretion of inshore reef slopes from the central Great Barrier Reef during the late Holocene	GEOLOGY			English	Article							CORAL-REEFS; GROWTH; RECORD	Coral reefs from the inshore Great Barrier Reef (GBR) initiated in the early Holocene, and have undergone a period of quiescence in recent millennia after reaching sea level. However, the capacity for accretion in adjacent reef slopes that are unrestricted by sea-level constraints is largely unknown. To explore this potential, we recovered 38 sediment cores (2-5 m length) from the reef slope (5 m depth) from two inshore fringing reefs (Pandora and Havannah Reefs) from the central GBR. We obtained 115 high-precision U-series ages from the core record to reconstruct a detailed late Holocene accretion record from 1000 yr ago to the present. Computed axial tomography scans of intact cores revealed a coral matrix with voids infilled with fine-grained carbonate-siliciclastic sediment. Accretion within cores was highly constrained through time (R-2 > 0.9) with no evidence of age reversals, indicating continuous and rapid (average 8.8 +/- 1.2 mm/yr) accretion throughout the late Holocene (i.e., 1000 yr ago to the present). Our results indicate rapid late Holocene accretion on reef slopes adjacent to senescent reef flats. Comparisons of these results with published reef accretion rates from Holocene reef flats on the inshore GBR indicate that where accommodation space is available, reef slopes continue to accrete at rates equal to and exceeding that occurring during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum.

Ocean acidification induces biochemical and morphological changes in the calcification process of large benthic foraminifera	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						large benthic foraminifera; ocean acidification; calcification; Ca-ATPase	SYMBIONT-BEARING FORAMINIFERA; MARGINOPORA-VERTEBRALIS; CARBONIC-ACID; BIOMINERALIZATION; SEAWATER; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPIRATION; PRODUCTIVITY; DISSOCIATION; DISSOLUTION	Large benthic foraminifera are significant contributors to sediment formation on coral reefs, yet they are vulnerable to ocean acidification. Here, we assessed the biochemical and morphological impacts of acidification on the calcification of Amphistegina lessonii and Marginopora vertebralis exposed to different pH conditions. We measured growth rates (surface area and buoyant weight) and Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities and calculated shell density using micro-computer tomography images. In A. lessonii, we detected a significant decrease in buoyant weight, a reduction in the density of inner skeletal chambers, and an increase of Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities at pH 7.6 when compared with ambient conditions of pH 8.1. By contrast, M. vertebralis showed an inhibition in Mg-ATPase activity under lowered pH, with growth rate and skeletal density remaining constant. While M. vertebralis is considered to be more sensitive than A. lessonii owing to its high-Mg-calcite skeleton, it appears to be less affected by changes in pH, based on the parameters assessed in this study. We suggest difference in biochemical pathways of calcification as the main factor influencing response to changes in pH levels, and that A. lessonii and M. vertebralis have the ability to regulate biochemical functions to cope with short-term increases in acidity.

Symbiodinium identity alters the temperature-dependent settlement behaviour of Acropora millepora coral larvae before the onset of symbiosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Symbiodinium; thermal tolerance; species interactions; coral recruitment; habitat selection	SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; THERMAL TOLERANCE; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; SURVIVORSHIP; RECOGNITION; DISPERSAL; MORTALITY; JUVENILES	The global distribution of marine species, many of which disperse during the larval stages, is influenced by ocean temperature regimes. Here, we test how temperature and the coral symbionts (Symbiodinium) affect survival, symbiont uptake, settlement success and habitat choice of Acropora millepora larvae. Experiments were conducted at Heron Island (Australia), where larvae were exposed to 22.5, 24.5, 26.5 and 28.5 degrees C. Within each temperature treatment, larvae were offered symbionts with distinct characteristics: (i) homologous Symbiodinium type C3, (ii) regionally homologous thermo-tolerant type D1, and (iii) heterologous thermo-tolerant type C15, as well as controls of (iv) un-filtered and (v) filtered seawater. Results show that lower instead of higher temperatures adversely affected recruitment by reducing larval survival and settlement. Low temperatures also reduced recruit habitat choice and initial symbiont densities, both of which impact on post-settlement survival. At lower temperatures, larvae increasingly settle away from preferred vertical surfaces and not on crustose coralline algae (CCA). Surprisingly, substrate preference to CCA was modified by the presence of specific symbiont genotypes that were present ex-hospite (outside the coral larvae). When different symbionts were mixed, the outcomes were non-additive, indicating that symbiont interactions modify the response. We propose that the observed influence of ex-hospite symbionts on settlement behaviour may have evolved through ecological facilitation and the study highlights the importance of biological processes during coral settlement.

Holocene benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicate long-term marginality of reef habitats from Moreton Bay, Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Holocene; Moreton Bay; Benthic foraminifera; Bio-indicators; Palaeoecology; Natural variability; Coral reefs	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SEA-LEVEL; LARGER FORAMINIFERA; CORAL-REEFS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SESOKO ISLAND; ENSO; QUEENSLAND; PACIFIC; QUALITY	Since European settlement (ca. 1824 CE), the subtropical inshore reefs of Moreton Bay have undergone rapid deterioration in water quality from changes in land-use practices, resource exploitation and rapid population growth, spurring marine managers to assess the drivers of ecological shifts. However, the short temporal-scale of most studies is an inadequate baseline for understanding the severity and magnitude of biological response. We present millennial-scale records employing palaeoecological and quantitative multivariate techniques within a concise chronological framework to analyse benthic foraminiferal community structure of reefs in Moreton Bay, Queensland. Well-constrained, UM-dated, millennial-scale records from sediment cores were used to document the long-term response of foraminifers to natural environmental variability. The temporal and spatial distribution patterns of foraminifers reveal long-term marginality throughout the similar to 7400 years of Holocene history, prior to European settlement. While specific faunal response to the effects of relative ENSO-climate and sea level fall are difficult to disentangle, the earlier phases of reef development are already represented by marginal taxa indicating possibly an earlier response to a decline in conditions. Overall, long-term consistency in conditions favoured two types of low diversity reef assemblages: 1) high density of small, heterotrophic and opportunistic species and 2) low density of photosymbiotic foraminiferal assemblages. Comparison of foraminiferal community composition between the Holocene and the present day indicates overlap in species composition supporting long-term marginality, particularly in the Western Bay. Such combined palaeoecological and recent studies can benefit long-term initiatives for monitoring present and future water quality conditions in the Bay's reef habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Ocean calamities are disruptive changes to ocean ecosystems that have profound impacts and that are widespread or global in scope. However, scrutiny of ocean calamities to ensure that they can be confidently attributed to human drivers, operate at widespread or global scales, and cause severe disruptions of marine social-ecosystems shows that some of the problems fail to meet these requirements or that the evidence is equivocal. A number of biases internal and external to the scientific community contribute to perpetuating the perception of ocean calamities in the absence of robust evidence. An organized auditing of ocean calamities may deliver a more precise diagnosis of the status of the oceans, which may help to identify the most pressing problems that need be addressed to conserve a healthy ocean.

Strengthening confidence in climate change impact science	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Abundance; attribution; climate change; distribution; hypothesis; impacts; marine; phenology; scientific method; time series	OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; RANGE LIMITS; MARINE FISH; TEMPERATURE; CALCIFICATION; POPULATIONS; ECOLOGY; REEF; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; MORTALITY	AimTo assess confidence in conclusions about climate-driven biological change through time, and identify approaches for strengthening confidence scientific conclusions about ecological impacts of climate change. LocationGlobal. MethodsWe outlined a framework for strengthening confidence in inferences drawn from biological climate impact studies through the systematic integration of prior expectations, long-term data and quantitative statistical procedures. We then developed a numerical confidence index (C-index) and used it to evaluate current practices in 208 studies of marine climate impacts comprising 1735 biological time series. ResultsConfidence scores for inferred climate impacts varied widely from 1 to 16 (very low to high confidence). Approximately 35% of analyses were not associated with clearly stated prior expectations and 65% of analyses did not test putative non-climate drivers of biological change. Among the highest-scoring studies, 91% tested prior expectations, 86% formulated expectations for alternative drivers but only 63% statistically tested them. Higher confidence scores observed in studies that did not detect a change or tracked multiple species suggest publication bias favouring impact studies that are consistent with climate change. The number of time series showing climate impacts was a poor predictor of average confidence scores for a given group, reinforcing that vote-counting methodology is not appropriate for determining overall confidence in inferences. Main conclusionsClimate impacts research is expected to attribute biological change to climate change with measurable confidence. Studies with long-term, high-resolution data, appropriate statistics and tests of alternative drivers earn higher C-index scores, suggesting these should be given greater weight in impact assessments. Together with our proposed framework, the results of our C-index analysis indicate how the science of detecting and attributing biological impacts to climate change can be strengthened through the use of evidence-based prior expectations and thorough statistical analyses, even when data are limited, maximizing the impact of the diverse and growing climate change ecology literature.

Incorporating Uncertainty in Predicting the Future Response of Coral Reefs to Climate Change	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 46	Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics		English	Review; Book Chapter						fossil record; evolution; evolutionary ecology; coral bleaching; ocean acidification; global warming	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; GROWTH-RATES; ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES; COMMUNITY CHANGE; GENE-EXPRESSION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; RANGE EXPANSION; MORTALITY RISK; GLOBAL CLIMATE	Coral reefs are considered one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to ongoing global climate change. However, geographic and taxonomic responses to climate change are highly variable, and fundamental aspects of key research approaches remain unresolved, leaving substantial uncertainty in our ability to predict the future of coral reefs. I review the ecological and evolutionary. response of coral reefs to climate change in a broad temporal context, primarily focusing on tropical reef corals. I show critical gaps in our understanding that impede accurate prediction of future responses. These gaps include the response of past reefs to global change, the interpretation of coral response to thermal stress and ocean acidification, how corals and other reef organisms might respond evolutionarily, and our approach to evaluating response to climate in the context of multiple stressors. Reducing uncertainty by filling these gaps and by incorporating variation in geographic and taxonomic response will substantially improve our ability to model coral reef futures and manage coral reefs.

SPATIAL, TEMPORAL AND TAXONOMIC VARIATION IN CORAL GROWTH-IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS	OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 53	Oceanography and Marine Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SKELETAL EXTENSION RATES; CARBONATE SATURATION STATE; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ACROPORA-ASPERA DANA; HIGH-LATITUDE REEFS; LONG-TERM DECLINE; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; BUILDING CORALS	Growth is a fundamental biological trait, generally considered to have an important role in structuring populations and communities. Accordingly, many studies have quantified growth rates of scleractinian corals, but using a variety of different methods and measures that may or may not be comparable. The purpose of this review is to compile extensive data on the growth of corals, to relate disparate methods of measuring coral growth, and to explore spatial, temporal, and taxonomic variation in growth rates. The most common metric of coral growth is linear extension, measured as unidirectional change in branch length or colony radius. Rates of linear extension vary greatly among corals, being highest among arborescent Acropora species. This is not unexpected given the limited carbonate investment in producing long, slender branches compared to solid hemispherical colonies. However, differences in the way that extension rates are actually measured (e.g., linear extension of individual branches vs. changes in the mean solid radius of massive corals) could potentially bias interspecific comparisons of coral growth. The most comparable measure of growth, which gives unbiased estimates of growth across different growth forms, is average annual calcification or change in weight normalized to a measure of size. Surprisingly, even calcification rates appear to be much higher for branching Acropora compared to other coral genera, which contributes to the high extension rates recorded for this genus. Despite inconsistencies and incompatibilities among studies of coral growth, there is clear evidence that coral growth rates vary spatially and temporally, largely in response to light and water quality (e.g., turbidity), temperature, and aragonite saturation state. Ongoing changes in environmental conditions (e.g., due to climate change) are expected to have generally negative consequences for the growth of scleractinian corals, which may be further exacerbated by shifts in assemblage structure towards relatively slowgrowing species.

High-precision U-Th dating of storm-transported coral blocks on Frankland Islands, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Storm activity; U-Th dating; Coral blocks; Great Barrier Reef	TROPICAL CYCLONES; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; MORTALITY EVENTS; INITIAL TH-230/TH-232; MODERN PORITES; SEA; VARIABILITY; SERIES; FREQUENCY; PACIFIC	High-energy storm-transported coral blocks are widespread on the reef flats of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and have the potential to be used as proxies for reconstructing past storm/cyclone events prior to historical or instrumental records. In this study, samples from 42 individual transported coral blocks were collected from the inshore Frankland Islands, northern GBR for high-precision MC-ICPMS U-Th dating with their surface mortality ages recording the timing of individual storms or cyclones responsible for their uplift from their original growth position. The dated mortality ages were found to match well with known historical storm/cyclone events in the last century, with 80% of them falling within episodes of increased storm activity (1910-1915, 1945-1950, 1955-1960, 1975-1990, 1995-2000 AD) captured by instrumental/historic records, confirming that transported coral blocks on inshore reefs can be used as proxies for past storm/cyclone occurrences. Using this approach, this study also identified 17 additional storm/cyclone events that occurred before European settlement in the 1850s, including three oldest events at 758.4 +/- 3.7, 777.9 +/- 4.9, and 985.2 +/- 4.8 AD, respectively. Our results, despite still preliminary, suggest that the storm/cyclone activity in this region tends to broadly correlate with the positive modes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the last millennium. In addition, there appears to be a decreasing age trend from the shore to the reef edge (from 758.4 +/- 3.7 AD to 1988.3 +/- 1.6 AD), which can be attributed to sea-level fall and/or reef/island progradation over the last 2000 years.

Testing the precision and accuracy of the U-Th chronometer for dating coral mortality events in the last 100 years	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY			English	Article						U-Th dating; MC-ICP-MS; Coral mortality; Acropora; Great Barrier Reef	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SOUTH CHINA SEA; ACROPORA-CERVICORNIS; PORITES CORALS; INITIAL TH-230/TH-232; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BLEACHING EVENTS; BASE-LINES; SERIES; RESILIENCE	To assist with our understanding of reef dynamics prior to modern monitoring programs and recent observations of coral decline, a robust dating technique is required to place coral mortality events and historical changes in community structure in an accurate chronological framework. In this study we adopted a refined Uranium-Thorium (U-Th) isotope measurement protocol using multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) for rapid, precise and accurate age determination of a large branching Acropora coral death assemblage from an inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where the timing of mortality is independently constrained. To achieve this, we developed a vigorous sample cleaning/treatment procedure to remove most non-carbonate detritus from the coral skeleton, and a correction scheme that accounts for initial Th-230 sources in the dead coral skeletons. Using this method, the Th-230 ages (with 2 sigma errors of 1-5 years) from 41 individual dead Acropora branches precisely bracket the timing of a documented similar to 100% loss of hard coral cover, primarily Acropora, that was caused by increased sea-surface temperatures during the 1997-1998 mass bleaching event. Our results demonstrate the applicability of U-Th dating in accurately determining the timing of previous disturbance events in coral reef communities, as well as identifying potential drivers. This approach provides a powerful tool to researchers and managers in assessing the current status of reefs and identifying areas vulnerable to degradation where long-term monitoring data are absent or too recent.

Variation in elemental stoichiometry and RNA:DNA in four phyla of benthic organisms from coral reefs	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Chlorophyta; coral; coral reefs; ecological stoichiometry; Great Barrier Reef; Lizard Island; macroalgae; Phaeophyta; Rhodophyta	N-P RATIOS; BIOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; STYLOPHORA-PISTILLATA; MARINE MACROALGAE; CHEMICAL ECOLOGY; FUNCTIONAL FORM; BUILDING CORALS; GENOME SIZE; GROWTH	The elemental composition of organisms has been linked to traits such as growth rates, through investment of phosphorus (P) in RNA (called the Growth Rate Hypothesis) and through ecological processes such as susceptibility to predation and herbivory. To test the predictions of the Growth Rate Hypothesis, we assessed the elemental composition and RNA of four phyla of common, co-occurring benthic coral reef organisms, corals, and green, brown and red macroalgae, whose patterns of dominance are predicted to be strongly influenced by differences in growth and herbivory and thus elemental stoichiometry. We assessed the importance of phylogeny and functional form, two important attributes for predicting the composition of macroalgal communities, on the variation in elemental composition. Over these widely divergent taxonomic groups of organisms, we found support for links between elemental composition and RNA in tissues. The RNA:DNA in corals was positively correlated with % nitrogen (N) and negatively correlated with carbon (C):N ratios of tissues while RNA:DNA and RNA concentrations in macroalgae were positively correlated with %N, N:P ratios and negatively correlated with C:N ratios. Corals had higher concentrations of P and lower C:P ratios than macroalgae. Among the macroalgal lineages, C:P was higher in the brown algae than in red and green algae. Overall, the variation in elemental composition of macroalgae was relatively low compared with the variation reported for terrestrial plants and similar to that in corals. Analysis of phylogenetic sources of variation (family and genus) in elemental composition and RNA found that genus accounted for a significant proportion of variation in both corals and macroalgae (15-47%), but the largest source of variation (50-97%) was unexplained by our statistical model and thus likely attributable to species and environmental factors. Although elemental composition of macroalgae did not vary in a way that was consistent with functional form models, genera with larger thalli had higher tissue N than smaller forms and more lineages with greater complexity of form had lower C:P ratios than less complex brown algal lineages. Our data indicate that the despite relatively low levels of variation in elemental composition compared with terrestrial organisms, elemental stoichiometry varied significantly among coral reef taxa and with the structure of organisms and thus may have potential for predicting variation in growth rates and patterns of consumption on coral reefs.

Discerning the timing and cause of historical mortality events in modern Porites from the Great Barrier Reef	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SOUTH CHINA SEA; MASSIVE PORITES; CORAL COMMUNITIES; INITIAL TH-230/TH-232; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SR/CA RATIOS; GROWTH; SERIES; VARIABILITY	The life history strategies of massive Porites corals make them a valuable resource not only as key providers of reef structure, but also as recorders of past environmental change. Yet recent documented evidence of an unprecedented increase in the frequency of mortality in Porites warrants investigation into the history of mortality and associated drivers. To achieve this, both an accurate chronology and an understanding of the life history strategies of Porites are necessary. Sixty-two individual Uranium-Thorium (U-Th) dates from 50 dead massive Porites colonies from the central inshore region of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) revealed the timing of mortality to have occurred predominantly over two main periods from 1989.2 +/- 4.1 to 2001.4 +/- 4.1, and from 2006.4 +/- 1.8 to 2008.4 2.2 A. D., with a small number of colonies dating earlier. Overall, the peak ages of mortality are significantly correlated with maximum sea-surface temperature anomalies. Despite potential sampling bias, the frequency of mortality increased dramatically post-1980. These observations are similar to the results reported for the Southern South China Sea. High resolution measurements of Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca obtained from a well preserved sample that died in 1994.6 +/- 2.3 revealed that the time of death occurred at the peak of sea surface temperatures (SST) during the austral summer. In contrast, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca analysis in two colonies dated to 2006.9 +/- 3.0 and 2008.3 +/- 2.0, suggest that both died after the austral winter. An increase in Sr/Ca ratios and the presence of low Mg-calcite cements (as determined by SEM and elemental ratio analysis) in one of the colonies was attributed to stressful conditions that may have persisted for some time prior to mortality. For both colonies, however, the timing of mortality coincides with the 4th and 6th largest flood events reported for the Burdekin River in the past 60 years, implying that factors associated with terrestrial runoff may have been responsible for mortality. Our results show that a combination of U-Th and elemental ratio geochemistry can potentially be used to precisely and accurately determine the timing and season of mortality in modern massive Porites corals. For reefs where long-term monitoring data are absent, the ability to reconstruct historical events in coral communities may prove useful to reef managers by providing some baseline knowledge on disturbance history and associated drivers.

EOCENE-MIOCENE SHALLOW-WATER CARBONATE PLATFORMS AND INCREASED HABITAT DIVERSITY IN SARAWAK, MALAYSIA	PALAIOS			English	Article							MICROFACIES ANALYSIS; SE ASIA; REEF; LIMESTONE; EVOLUTION; SHELF; RAMP; RECONSTRUCTION; FORAMINIFERA; ASSEMBLAGES	The Indo-Pacific marine biodiversity hotspot originated between the late Eocene and the early Miocene. Its origin coincides with an increase in availability of shallow-marine habitats driven by the opening of the South China Sea and the collision of Australia with the Pacific arcs and the southeast Asian margin. However, little is known about the distribution and diversity of past Indo-Pacific marine habitats. Understanding habitat diversity is key for understanding the significance of biodiversity origins and a necessary prerequisite for interpreting biodiversity patterns through time. Here we describe and interpret past carbonate platform environments in Sarawak, Malaysia during a time of active tectonism. We examine upper Eocene to lower Miocene marine shallow-water carbonate deposits from six localities in two limestone formations: the large ramplike Melinau carbonate platform (middle Eocene to early Miocene) and the unattached Subis carbonate platform (early Miocene). Deposits examined in this study represent paleoenvironments. Our analysis reveals an increase in habitat diversity from the Eocene to the Miocene. Mesophotic to oligophotic low-energy environments are typical for the Eocene sites. The corals first appear in the Oligocene deposits, but genuine reef depositional settings are not observed until the Miocene. This study provides both insight into the evolution of the carbonate platform environments along the Sarawak margin, and context for the origin of the Indo-Pacific marine biodiversity hotspot.

Because ancient reefs have been exposed to multiple episodes of environmental change, the fossil record provides an important resource for understanding the range of responses of coral reefs to climate change. Reef development has been slowed or stopped repeatedly in the history of life during periods of climate change. Whilst current conditions might be beyond some of the environmental ranges experienced throughout much of earth's history, coral reefs have shown a remarkable resilience to past climate change. Their fate today lies in the interaction between climate change and local anthropogenic stressors that have devastated a large proportion of living reef ecosystems.

Trait-mediated environmental filtering drives assembly at biogeographic transition zones	ECOLOGY			English	Article						latitudinal gradient; environmental filtering; community assembly; high-latitude reefs; functional traits; biogeography; life-history strategy; scleractinian corals; range limit	CORAL-REEF; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; MARINE; LIMITS; NICHE	Abiotic filtering is a major driver of gradients in the structure and functioning of ecosystems from the tropics to the poles. It is thus likely that environmental filtering is an important assembly process at the transition of biogeographical zones where many species occur at their range limits. Shifts in species abundances and association patterns along environmental gradients can be indicative of environmental filtering, which is predicted to be stronger in areas of high abiotic stress and to promote increased similarity of ecological characteristics among co-occurring species. Here we test these hypotheses for scleractinian corals along a broad latitudinal gradient in high-latitude eastern Australia, where corals occur at the margins of their ranges and environmental tolerances. We quantify variation in taxonomic, zoogeographic, and functional patterns combined with null model approaches and demonstrate systematic spatial variation in community structure and significant covariance of species abundance distributions and functional characteristics along the latitudinal gradient. We describe a strong biogeographic transition zone, consistent with patterns expected under abiotic filtering, whereby species are sorted along the latitudinal gradient according to their tolerances for marginal reef conditions. High-latitude coastal reefs are typified by widely distributed, generalist, stress-tolerant coral species with massive and horizontally spreading morphologies and by diminishing influence of tropical taxa at higher latitudes and closer to the mainland. Higher degree of ecological similarity among co-occurring species than expected by chance supports the environmental filtering hypothesis. Among individual traits, the structural traits corallite size and colony morphology were filtered most strongly, suggesting that characteristics linked to energy acquisition and physical stability may be particularly important for coral survival in high-latitude environments. These findings highlight interspecific differences and species interactions with the environment as key drivers of community organization in biogeographic transition zones and support the hypothesis that environmental filters play a stronger role than biotic interactions in structuring ecological communities in areas of high abiotic stress.

Geographical limits to species-range shifts are suggested by climate velocity	NATURE			English	Article							BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; MARINE; DISTRIBUTIONS; IMPACTS; ANALOG	The reorganization of patterns of species diversity driven by anthropogenic climate change, and the consequences for humans(1), are not yet fully understood or appreciated(2,3). Nevertheless, changes in climate conditions are useful for predicting shifts in species distributions at global(4) and local scales(5). Here we use the velocity of climate change(6,7) to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches from 1960 to 2009 (ref. 7) and from 2006 to 2100, and use the properties of these trajectories to infer changes in species distributions. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors for trajectories, creating source and sink areas for local climatic conditions. Climate source areas indicate where locally novel conditions are not connected to areas where similar climates previously occurred, and are thereby inaccessible to climate migrants tracking isotherms: 16% of global surface area for 1960 to 2009, and 34% of ocean for the 'business as usual' climate scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5)(8) representing continued use of fossil fuels without mitigation. Climate sink areas are where climate conditions locally disappear, potentially blocking the movement of climate migrants. Sink areas comprise 1.0% of ocean area and 3.6% of land and are prevalent on coasts and high ground. Using this approach to infer shifts in species distributions gives global and regional maps of the expected direction and rate of shifts of climate migrants, and suggests areas of potential loss of species richness.

While precipitation and river flow variability in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments are sensitive to PDO phases, the extent to which the PDO influences coral reefs is poorly understood. Here, six Porites coral cores were used to produce a composite record of coral luminescence variability (runoff proxy) and identify drivers of terrestrial influence on the Keppel reefs, southern GBR. We found that coral skeletal luminescence effectively captured seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variability of river discharge and rainfall from the Fitzroy River catchment. Most importantly, although the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events was evident in the luminescence records, the variability in the coral luminescence composite record was significantly explained by the PDO. Negative luminescence anomalies (reduced runoff) were associated with El Nino years during positive PDO phases while positive luminescence anomalies (increased runoff) coincided with strong/moderate La Nino years during negative PDO phases. This study provides clear evidence that not only ENSO but also the PDO have significantly affected runoff regimes at the Keppel reefs for at least a century, and suggests that upcoming hydrological disturbances and ecological responses in the southern GBR region will be mediated by the future evolution of these sources of climate variability.

The impacts of flooding on the high-latitude, terrigenoclastic influenced coral reefs of Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Marginal; Turbid; High-latitude; Flood; Australia; Coral	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SEAGRASS MEADOWS; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; RECOVERY; MECHANISMS; DECLINE	This study examines the impacts of an acute flooding event on the marginal, high-latitude, terrigenoclastic influenced coral reefs of Hervey Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. In January 2011, the Mary River near Hervey Bay experienced its eleventh highest flood on record. The Mary River catchment has been highly modified since European colonisation, and, as a result of heavy rain and flooding, Hervey Bay was exposed to reduced salinity and elevated levels of turbidity and nutrients for approximately 14 weeks. Through the use of photograph transects and point intercept analysis, per cent cover of coral reef benthic communities was measured prior to and just after the flooding event. Sites were located between 250 m and 5 km from the mainland and from 18 to 85 km away from the mouth of the Mary River. Overall, there was a similar to 40 % reduction in coral cover post-flood, including significant mortality up to 89 % at four of six reefs. Mortality did not vary with distance along the coast from the Mary River, but mortality was found to be highest closer to the mainland, where turbidity and nutrients levels were also the highest. Despite the decades of input of highly turbid and nutrient laden waters from the Mary River, recovery has occurred in the past, and, given the persistence of similar conditions, would be expected to take place again. Climate change predicts increased frequency of severe storms and flooding, and this, combined with elevated sedimentation and nutrients from the highly modified catchment, may reduce these recovery periods, resulting in the deterioration of Hervey Bay reef communities.

Predicting evolutionary responses to climate change in the sea	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Review						Adaptation; evolutionary potential; genetic variation; global warming; marine biodiversity; ocean acidification; phenotypic plasticity; quantitative genetics	OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ACCLIMATION CAPACITY; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; REEF CORALS; MARINE; ADAPTATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS	An increasing number of short-term experimental studies show significant effects of projected ocean warming and ocean acidification on the performance on marine organisms. Yet, it remains unclear if we can reliably predict the impact of climate change on marine populations and ecosystems, because we lack sufficient understanding of the capacity for marine organisms to adapt to rapid climate change. In this review, we emphasise why an evolutionary perspective is crucial to understanding climate change impacts in the sea and examine the approaches that may be useful for addressing this challenge. We first consider what the geological record and present-day analogues of future climate conditions can tell us about the potential for adaptation to climate change. We also examine evidence that phenotypic plasticity may assist marine species to persist in a rapidly changing climate. We then outline the various experimental approaches that can be used to estimate evolutionary potential, focusing on molecular tools, quantitative genetics, and experimental evolution, and we describe the benefits of combining different approaches to gain a deeper understanding of evolutionary potential. Our goal is to provide a platform for future research addressing the evolutionary potential for marine organisms to cope with climate change.

Global imprint of climate change on marine life	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CHANGE IMPACTS; RANGE SHIFTS; FINGERPRINT; PHENOLOGY	Past meta-analyses of the response of marine organisms to climate change have examined a limited range of locations(1,2), taxonomic groups(2-4) and/or biological responses(5,6). This has precluded a robust overview of the effect of climate change in the global ocean. Here, we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta-database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81-83% of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shifts were, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species' distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems.

Historical Patterns of Resource Exploitation and the Status of Papua New Guinea Coral Reefs	PACIFIC SCIENCE			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CONSERVATION METHODS; TRIDACNA-GIGAS; GIANT CLAMS; ECOSYSTEMS; COMMUNITY; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; AUSTRALIA	Understanding human drivers of exploitation within the context of historical baselines can assist in better management of natural resources. Retrospective studies provide insight into the scale, nature, and timing of human influence on reef ecosystems. Using Papua New Guinea as a model, we assessed human influences on the historical status of reef resources through time. Reef resources were divided into seven ecological guilds, assessed over seven cultural periods and in reference to seven types of human influences. Ranking of ecological status and human influence was performed based on extensive bibliographical research. Evidence for periods of sustainability and depletion were found throughout historical and modern periods. More recently, acceleration in the rate of resource depletion has occurred as a result of increasing pressure at unprecedented scales. Subsistence lifestyles are becoming unviable or unattractive since the introduction of the cash economy during colonial times. Current challenges such as providing livelihood options and sustaining replenishment rates of reef resources have arisen from a long history of overexploitation that preconditioned the current status of reef resources under an economic climate of increasing demand for these resources. Studies of past human exploitation of reef resources can help to overcome the shifting baseline syndrome for fisheries management in marine ecosystems and help characterize the scale and intensity of human drivers influencing resource exploitation.

Millennium-scale records of benthic foraminiferal communities from the central Great Barrier Reef reveal spatial differences and temporal consistency	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Historical range of variability; community ecology; persistence; benthic foraminifers; Palm Island; Great Barrier Reef; Holocene; coral reef	CARBON-ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; NORTHERN ADRIATIC SEA; ORGANIC-MATTER; WATER-QUALITY; CORAL-REEFS; HUON PENINSULA; SEDIMENT; BAY; VEGETATION; INDICATORS	Understanding long-term community dynamics and the ways in which they respond to major disturbances is a central management theme within coastal marine ecosystems. River outputs from the Queensland coastline directly affect inshore marine communities of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Of these, the Burdekin River exports the highest volume of terrestrial runoff. Following European settlement in the mid-19th century, over three quarters of the native vegetation from the Burdekin catchment were cleared for agricultural purposes. Despite such extensive historical catchment modification, the impact of these changes on the inshore GBR is largely unknown, primarily due to the paucity of long-term ecological data. To assess the effects of modem land-use change on inshore reef environments and to establish an historical baseline of community structure, we examined the sedimentary geochemistry and benthic foraminiferal assemblages of eight sediment cores collected from two coral reefs situated inside (Pandora) and outside (Havannah) an inner-shelf sediment prism formed during the Holocene. Foraminiferal community structure was reconstructed from the past millennium, and the time series was constrained using U-series dating of coral fragments within the cores. Environmental records were reconstructed using stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) and elemental C:N ratios from bulk sediment samples. Non-parametric analysis of community structure in benthic foraminifers indicated no change in community structure through time at either reef. Despite this apparent ecological persistence through time, significant differences in foraminiferal community structure were observed between the two reefs. The communities were clearly characterized by different functional groups; heterotrophic genera were persistent within, and symbiont-bearing genera were persistent outside, the Holocene inshore sediment wedge. We found no difference in the source of organic matter (interpreted from delta C-13 values) either between reefs or through time, yet elemental C:N ratios indicated a difference in the amount of organic matter between reefs. The influence of the Holocene inshore sediment wedge was demonstrated by the dissimilarity in sedimentary C:N ratios between the two reefs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Palaeoecological evidence of a historical collapse of corals at Pelorus Island, inshore Great Barrier Reef, following European settlement	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						coral; Acropora; palaeoecology; historical mortality; Great Barrier Reef; European settlement	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; PHASE-SHIFTS; BASE-LINES; BLEACHING EVENTS; DISTURBANCE; RESILIENCE; RECORD; COVER; SHELF	The inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have undergone significant declines in water quality following European settlement (approx. 1870 AD). However, direct evidence of impacts on coral assemblages is limited by a lack of historical baselines prior to the onset of modern monitoring programmes in the early 1980s. Through palaeoecological reconstructions, we report a previously undocumented historical collapse of Acropora assemblages at Pelorus Island (central GBR). High-precision U-series dating of dead Acropora fragments indicates that this collapse occurred between 1920 and 1955, with fewdates obtained after 1980. Prior to this event, our results indicate remarkable long-term stability in coral community structure over centennial scales. We suggest that chronic increases in sediment flux and nutrient loading following European settlement acted as the ultimate cause for the lack of recovery of Acropora assemblages following a series of acute disturbance events (SST anomalies, cyclones and flood events). Evidence for major degradation in reef condition owing to human impacts prior to modern ecological surveys indicates that current monitoring of inshore reefs on the GBR may be predicated on a significantly shifted baseline.

Decline in growth of foraminifer Marginopora rossi under eutrophication and ocean acidification scenarios	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Review						biomineralization; eutrophication; foraminiferal physiology; high-Mg calcite; ocean acidification	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; BEARING BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; WATER COLUMN NUTRIENTS; INORGANIC CARBON; REDUCED CALCIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPIRATION; VERTEBRALIS	The combination of global and local stressors is leading to a decline in coral reef health globally. In the case of eutrophication, increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) are largely attributed to local land use changes. From the global perspective, increased atmospheric CO2 levels are not only contributing to global warming but also ocean acidification (OA). Both eutrophication and OA have serious implications for calcium carbonate production and dissolution among calcifying organisms. In particular, benthic foraminifera precipitate the most soluble form of mineral calcium carbonate (high-Mg calcite), potentially making them more sensitive to dissolution. In this study, a manipulative orthogonal two-factor experiment was conducted to test the effects of dissolved inorganic nutrients and OA on the growth, respiration and photophysiology of the large photosymbiont-bearing benthic foraminifer, Marginopora rossi. This study found the growth rate of M. rossi was inhibited by the interaction of eutrophication and acidification. The relationship between M. rossi and its photosymbionts became destabilized due to the photosymbiont's release from nutrient limitation in the nitrate-enriched treatment, as shown by an increase in zooxanthellae cells per host surface area. Foraminifers from the OA treatments had an increased amount of Chl a per cell, suggesting a greater potential to harvest light energy, however, there was no net benefit to the foraminifer growth. Overall, this study demonstrates that the impacts of OA and eutrophication are dose dependent and interactive. This research indicates an OA threshold at pH 7.6, alone or in combination with eutrophication, will lead to a decline in M. rossi calcification. The decline in foraminifera calcification associated with pollution and OA will have broad ecological implications across their ubiquitous range and suggests that without mitigation it could have serious implications for the future of coral reefs.

Equatorial decline of reef corals during the last Pleistocene interglacial	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						biodiversity; climate change; paleobiology	RANGE SHIFTS; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; COMMUNITY DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; MARINE; TEMPERATURES; RECORD; OCEAN; ASSEMBLAGES	The Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 125,000 y ago) resulted from rapid global warming and reached global mean temperatures exceeding those of today. The LIG thus offers the opportunity to study how life may respond to future global warming. Using global occurrence databases and applying sampling-standardization, we compared reef coral diversity and distributions between the LIG and modern. Latitudinal diversity patterns are characterized by a tropical plateau today but were characterized by a pronounced equatorial trough during the LIG. This trough is governed by substantial range shifts away from the equator. Range shifts affected both leading and trailing edges of species range limits and were much more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere than south of the equator. We argue that interglacial warming was responsible for the loss of equatorial diversity. Hemispheric differences in insolation during the LIG may explain the asymmetrical response. The equatorial retractions are surprisingly strong given that only small temperature changes have been reported in the LIG tropics. Our results suggest that the poleward range expansions of reef corals occurring with intensified global warming today may soon be followed by equatorial range retractions.

Aims of these workshops were to produce a global synthesis of climate impacts on marine biota, to identify sensitive habitats and taxa, to inform the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process, and to strengthen research into ecological impacts of climate change.

Species Differences Drive Nonneutral Structure in Pleistocene Coral Communities	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						island biogeography; paleontology; linear growth rates; community assembly; coral reefs; Barbados; Caribbean	SKELETAL EXTENSION RATES; UNIFIED-NEUTRAL-THEORY; TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; HIGH-DIVERSITY; REEF; BIODIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; COEXISTENCE; COMPETITION	Although ecological assemblages frequently depart from neutral model predictions, these discrepancies have not been unambiguously attributed to neutral theory's core assumption: that community structure is primarily the result of chance variation in birth, death, speciation, and dispersal, rather than the manifestation of demographic differences among species. Using coral communities in Barbados from four time periods during the Pleistocene, we demonstrate that the neutral theory cannot explain coral community similarity distributions, species' regional abundance distributions, or their local occupancy. Furthermore, discrepancies between the neutral theory and the observed communities can be attributed to violation of the core assumption of species equivalence. In particular, species' variable growth rates are driving departures from neutral predictions. Our results reinforce an understanding of reef coral community assembly that invokes trade-offs in species' demographic strategies. The results further suggest that conservation management actions will fail if they are based on the neutral assumption that different coral species are equally able to create live coral cover in the shallow-water reef environment. These findings highlight the importance of developing biodiversity theory that can parsimoniously incorporate species differences in coral reef communities, rather than further elaborating neutral theory.

Extinctions in ancient and modern seas	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							EOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; MASS EXTINCTIONS; MARINE; RISK; CORAL; BIODIVERSITY; ORIGINATION; DIVERSITY	In the coming century, life in the ocean will be confronted with a suite of environmental conditions that have no analog in human history. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine which marine species will adapt and which will go extinct. Here, we review the growing literature on marine extinctions and extinction risk in the fossil, historical, and modern records to compare the patterns, drivers, and biological correlates of marine extinctions at different times in the past. Characterized by markedly different environmental states, some past periods share common features with predicted future scenarios. We highlight how the different records can be integrated to better understand and predict the impact of current and projected future environmental changes on extinction risk in the ocean.

Ages of the Hato (upper) unit of the "Lower Terrace" indicate that this reef dates to the last interglacial period, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5.5. On Curacao, this high sea stand lasted at least 8000 yr (similar to 126 to similar to 118 ka). Elevations and age of this reef show that late Quaternary uplift rates on Curacao are low, 0.026-0.054 m/ka, consistent with its tectonic setting. Ages of similar to 200 ka for corals from the older Cortalein unit of the Lower Terrace correlate this reef to MIS 7, with paleo-sea level estimates ranging from -3.3 m to +2.3 m. The estimates are in agreement with those for MIS 7 made from other localities and indicate that the penultimate interglacial period was a time of significant warmth, on a par with the present interglacial period. The similar to 400 ka (MIS 11) Middle Terrace I on Curacao, dated by others, may have formed from a paleo-sea level of +8.3 to +10.0 m, or (less likely) +17 m to +20 m. The lower estimates are conservative compared to previous studies, but still require major ice sheet loss from Greenland and Antarctica.

The effect of nutrient enrichment on the growth, nucleic acid concentrations, and elemental stoichiometry of coral reef macroalgae	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Ecostoichiometry; eutrophication; growth rate hypothesis; luxury uptake; tropical algae	N-P STOICHIOMETRY; RNA-DNA RATIO; NITROGEN-FIXATION; MARINE MACROALGAE; WATER-QUALITY; PHASE-SHIFTS; KANEOHE BAY; PHOSPHORUS; PHOSPHATE; KINETICS	The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) links growth rates with organism elemental stoichiometry. Support for the GRH was found for many animal species, but less so for plants. This is the first study to test the GRH in macroalgae. Tropical coral reef macroalgae from three lineages, Caulerpa serrulata (Chlorophyta), Laurencia intricata (Rhodophyta), and Sargassum polyphyllum (Phaeophyceae) were grown enriched with nitrogen or phosphorous and under control conditions at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Growth rate, photosynthesis, nucleic acid composition, and elemental stoichiometry were measured. Nutrient enrichment had positive effects on photosynthetic rates and on investment in RNA. However, growth rate was not correlated with either photosynthetic rates or RNA content; thus, we did not find support for the GRH in tropical macroalgae. Macroalgae, especially L. intricata, accumulated P to very high levels (>0.6% of dry weight). The growth rate response to tissue P concentrations was unimodal. Above 0.21%, P accumulation had negative effects on growth. Nitrogen was not stored, but evidence of futile cycling was observed. The capacity to store large amounts of P is probably an adaptation to the low and patchy nutrient environment of the tropical oceans.

Important insights into the origins, evolutionary history, and maintenance of Indo-Pacific reef faunas depend upon the analysis of faunal occurrences derived from detailed stratigraphic sections. We investigated Neogene origination and extinction patterns derived from a combination of new coral occurrences and previously published records from the central Indo-West Pacific Ocean (cIWP, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji). Two faunal turnover events were observed. In the first, an increase in generic richness of Scleractinia from the cIWP during the middle Miocene (17-14 Ma) coincided with both large-scale sea level fluctuations and the great Mid-Miocene collision event. We raise the hypothesis that Mid-Miocene origination was facilitated by habitat and population fragmentation associated with tectonism and sea level fall. The second, subsequent, turnover event was characterized by an overall lowering of generic diversity throughout the late Miocene and Pliocene (7-3 Ma), and was followed by a pronounced pulse of extinction at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary (similar to 2.6 Ma). With the exception of the onset of Pleistocene sea-level cycles and the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation around 2.5 Ma, which might explain increased extinction during this time interval, there are no tectonic, eustatic, climatic or oceanographic events that neatly coincide with this second episode of Neogene coral taxonomic turnover. Our results reveal a total of 62 genera, including synonyms, from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. Neither episode of turnover among coral genera is exactly coincident with turnover in the Atlantic thus regional environmental change is found to drive Neogene reef dynamics.

Polymorphism in a common Atlantic reef coral (Montastraea cavernosa) and its long-term evolutionary implications	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cryptic species; Reef coral; Caribbean; Geometric morphometrics; beta-tubulin; Neogene	SPECIES COMPLEX ANTHOZOA; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GENE FLOW; ANNULARIS; SCLERACTINIA; MITOCHONDRIAL; MORPHOLOGY; SYSTEMATICS; SPECIATION; PATTERNS	Recent advances in morphometrics and genetics have led to the discovery of numerous cryptic species in coral reef ecosystems. A prime example is the Montastraea annularis scleractinian coral species complex, in which morphological, genetic, and reproductive data concur on species boundaries, allowing evaluation of long-term patterns of speciation and evolutionary innovation. Here we test for cryptic species in the Atlantic species, Montastraea cavernosa, long recognized as polymorphic. Our modern samples consist of 94 colonies collected at four locations (Belize, Panama, Puerto Rico in the Caribbean; So Tom, in the Eastern Atlantic). Our fossil samples consist of 78 colonies from the Plio-Pleistocene of Costa Rica and Panama. Landmark morphometric data were collected on thin sections of 46 modern and 78 fossil colonies. Mahalanobis distances between colonies were calculated using Bookstein coordinates, revealing two modern and four fossil morphotypes. The remaining 48 of the 94 modern colonies were assigned to morphotype using discriminant analysis of calical measurements. Cross-tabulation and multiple comparisons tests show no significant morphological differences among geographic locations or water depths. Patterns of variation within and among fossil morphotypes are similar to modern morphotypes. DNA sequence data were collected for two polymorphic nuclear loci (beta-tub1 and beta-tub2) on all 94 modern colonies. Haplotype networks show that both genes consist of two clades, but morphotypes are not associated with genetic clades. Genotype frequencies and two-locus genotype assignments indicate genetic exchange across clades, and I center dot st values show no genetic differentiation between morphotypes at different locations. Taken together, our morphological and genetic results do not provide evidence for cryptic species in M. cavernosa, but indicate instead that this species has an unusually high degree of polymorphism over a wide geographic area and persisting for > 25 million years (myr).

Jackson, and is written by a sample of his students, post-docs, and colleagues over his career. Jackson is an influential leader in cross-disciplinary research integrating ecology and paleontology. His contributions are broad in scope, and range in topic from the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the formation of the Central American Isthmus to the long-term impacts of human activities on the oceans. Two areas of particular interest have been the evolutionary ecology of coral reef organisms and the tempo and mode of speciation in the sea. Papers in the collection examine: colonial marine animals (Buss and Rice, Lidgard et al.), marrying genes and fossils (Budd et al., Marko and Hart, Palumbi et al., Jagadeeshan and O'Dea), the geography, tempo, and mode of evolution (Bromfield and Pandolfi, Norris and Hull, Vermeij, Erwin and Tweedt), and marine ecosystem health (Sandin and Sala).

Spatial variability of initial Th-230/Th-232 in modern Porites from the inshore region of the Great Barrier Reef	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							NINO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; CORAL-REEFS; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; DUST TRANSPORT; SERIES; SEDIMENT; SEA; LAGOON; QUEENSLAND; CLIMATE	The main limiting factor in obtaining precise and accurate uranium-series (U-series) ages of corals that lived during the last few hundred years is the ability to constrain and correct for initial thorium-230 (Th-230(0)), which is proportionally much higher in younger samples. This is becoming particularly important in palaeoecological research where accurate chronologies, based on the Th-230 chronometer, are required to pinpoint changes in coral community structure and the timing of mortality events in recent time (e.g. since European settlement of northern Australia in the 1850s). In this study, thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) U-series dating of 43 samples of known ages collected from living Porites spp. from the far northern, central and southern inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was performed to spatially constrain initial Th-230/Th-232 (Th-230/Th-232(0)) variability. In these living Porites corals, the majority of Th-230/Th-232(0) values fell within error of the conservative bulk Earth Th-230/Th-232 atomic value of 4.3 +/- 4.3 x 10(-6) (2 sigma) generally assumed for Th-230(0) corrections where the primary source is terrestrially derived. However, the results of this study demonstrate that the accuracy of Th-230 ages can be further improved by using locally determined Th-230/Th-232(0) values for correction, supporting the conclusion made by Shen et al. (2008) for the Western Pacific. Despite samples being taken from regions adjacent to contrasting levels of land modification, no significant differences were found in Th-230/Th-232(0) between regions exposed to varying levels of sediment during river runoff events. Overall, 39 of the total 43 Th-230/Th-232(0) atomic values measured in samples from inshore reefs across the entire region show a normal distribution ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.1 to 8.1 +/- 1.1 x 10(-6), with a weighted mean of 5.76 +/- 0.34 x 10(-6) (2 sigma, MSWD = 8.1). Considering the scatter of the data, the weighted mean value with a more conservative assigned error of 25% (i.e. 5.8 perpendicular to 1.4 x 10(-6)) that encompasses the full variation of the 39 Th-230/Th-232(0) measurements is recommended as a more appropriate value for initial Th-230 corrections for U-series dating of most Porites samples from inshore regions of the GBR. This will result in significant improvement in both the precision and accuracy of the corrected Th-230 ages related to those based on the assumed bulk Earth Th-230/Th-232(0) value of 4.3 +/- 4.3 x 10(-6). However, several anomalously high Th-230/Th-232(0) values reaching up to 28.0 +/- 1.6 x 10(-6) occasionally found in some coral annual bands coinciding with El Nino years imply high Th-230/Th-232(0) sources and highlight the complexities of understanding Th-230/Th-232(0) variability. For U-series dating of young coral samples from such sites where anomalous Th-230/Th-232(0) values occur, we suggest replicate dating of multiple growth bands with known age difference to verify age accuracy.

Population genetics of Australian white sharks reveals fine-scale spatial structure, transoceanic dispersal events and low effective population sizes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Carcharodon carcharias; Population structure; Philopatry; Effective population size; Population genetics; Conservation; Nursery areas; Reproductive strategy	SEX-BIASED DISPERSAL; ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; GUADALUPE ISLAND; SHORTFIN MAKO; LEMON SHARKS; N-E	Despite international protection of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias, important conservation parameters such as abundance, population structure and genetic diversity are largely unknown. The tissue of 97 predominately juvenile white sharks sampled from spatially distant eastern and southwestern Australian coastlines was sequenced for the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and genotyped with 6 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. MtDNA population structure was found between the eastern and southwestern coasts (F-ST = 0.142, p < 0.0001), implying female reproductive philopatry. This concurs with recent satellite and acoustic tracking findings which suggest the sustained presence of discrete east coast nursery areas. Furthermore, population subdivision was found between the same regions with biparentally inherited micro satellite markers (F-ST = 0.009, p < 0.05), suggesting that males may also exhibit some degree of reproductive philopatry; 5 sharks captured along the east coast had mtDNA haplotypes that resembled western Indian Ocean sharks more closely than Australian/New Zealand sharks, suggesting that transoceanic dispersal, or migration resulting in breeding, may occur sporadically. Our most robust estimate of contemporary genetic effective population size was low and close to thresholds at which adaptive potential may be lost. For a variety of reasons, these contemporary estimates were at least 1, possibly 2, orders of magnitude below our historical effective size estimates. Population decline could expose these genetically isolated populations to detrimental genetic effects. Regional Australian white shark conservation management units should be implemented until genetic population structure, size and diversity can be investigated in more detail.

Yet these projected climate and ocean change impacts are rarely considered in conservation planning due to the lack of guidance on how existing climate and ocean change models, tools, and data can be applied. Here, we address this gap by describing how conservation planning can use available tools and data for assessing the vulnerability of tropical marine ecosystems to key climate threats. Additionally, we identify limitations of existing tools and provide recommendations for future research to improve integration of climate and ocean change information and conservation planning. Such information is critical for developing a conservation response that adequately protects these ecosystems and dependent coastal communities in the face of climate and ocean change.

Quantitative approaches in climate change ecology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Review							LONG-TERM CHANGES; REGIME SHIFTS; BERING-SEA; MARINE; IMPACT; ABUNDANCE; ZOOPLANKTON; ECOSYSTEM; PLANKTON; AUTOCORRELATION	Contemporary impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems are increasingly being recognized. Documenting the extent of these impacts requires quantitative tools for analyses of ecological observations to distinguish climate impacts in noisy data and to understand interactions between climate variability and other drivers of change. To assist the development of reliable statistical approaches, we review the marine climate change literature and provide suggestions for quantitative approaches in climate change ecology. We compiled 267 peer-reviewed articles that examined relationships between climate change and marine ecological variables. Of the articles with time series data (n = 186), 75% used statistics to test for a dependency of ecological variables on climate variables. We identified several common weaknesses in statistical approaches, including marginalizing other important non-climate drivers of change, ignoring temporal and spatial autocorrelation, averaging across spatial patterns and not reporting key metrics. We provide a list of issues that need to be addressed to make inferences more defensible, including the consideration of (i) data limitations and the comparability of data sets; (ii) alternative mechanisms for change; (iii) appropriate response variables; (iv) a suitable model for the process under study; (v) temporal autocorrelation; (vi) spatial autocorrelation and patterns; and (vii) the reporting of rates of change. While the focus of our review was marine studies, these suggestions are equally applicable to terrestrial studies. Consideration of these suggestions will help advance global knowledge of climate impacts and understanding of the processes driving ecological change.

The Pace of Shifting Climate in Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems	SCIENCE			English	Article							LONG-TERM CHANGES; RANGE SHIFTS; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; SCENARIOS; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; RATES	Climate change challenges organisms to adapt or move to track changes in environments in space and time. We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts.

Historical Reconstruction Reveals Recovery in Hawaiian Coral Reefs	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN IMPACTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENT; COLLAPSE; ECOLOGY; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSERVATION; AGRICULTURE; DEGRADATION; LANDSCAPE	Coral reef ecosystems are declining worldwide, yet regional differences in the trajectories, timing and extent of degradation highlight the need for in-depth regional case studies to understand the factors that contribute to either ecosystem sustainability or decline. We reconstructed social-ecological interactions in Hawaiian coral reef environments over 700 years using detailed datasets on ecological conditions, proximate anthropogenic stressor regimes and social change. Here we report previously undetected recovery periods in Hawaiian coral reefs, including a historical recovery in the MHI (similar to AD 1400-1820) and an ongoing recovery in the NWHI (similar to AD 1950-2009+). These recovery periods appear to be attributed to a complex set of changes in underlying social systems, which served to release reefs from direct anthropogenic stressor regimes. Recovery at the ecosystem level is associated with reductions in stressors over long time periods (decades+) and large spatial scales (>10(3) km(2)). Our results challenge conventional assumptions and reported findings that human impacts to ecosystems are cumulative and lead only to long-term trajectories of environmental decline. In contrast, recovery periods reveal that human societies have interacted sustainably with coral reef environments over long time periods, and that degraded ecosystems may still retain the adaptive capacity and resilience to recover from human impacts.

Shifting base-lines, declining coral cover, and the erosion of reef resilience: comment on Sweatman et al. (2011)	CORAL REEFS			English	Article						Shifting base-lines; Climate change; Monitoring; Coral cover	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; WORLD HERITAGE AREA; OF-THORNS STARFISH; LONG-TERM DECLINE; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ACANTHASTER-PLANCI; CARIBBEAN CORALS; NORTHERN REGION; COASTAL WATERS	Formal monitoring of the Great Barrier Reef was initiated in 1986 in response to the clear scientific evidence (and growing public concern) over the loss of corals caused by two protracted outbreaks of crown-of thorns starfish, which began in 1962 and 1979. Using monitoring data from manta tows along and across the Great Barrier Reef, Sweatman et al. (Coral Reefs 30:521-531, 2011) show that coral cover after these outbreaks declined further from 28 to 22% between 1986 and 2004. Pointing to the current levels of protection of the Great Barrier Reef, they state that earlier estimates of losses of coral cover since the early 1960s have been exaggerated. However, the loss of close to one-quarter of the coral cover over the past two decades represents an average loss of 0.34% cover per year across the whole GBR after 1986, which is very similar to previously reported rates of annual loss measured over a longer timeframe. The heaviest recent losses have occurred on inshore and mid-shelf reefs, which Sweatman et al. (Coral Reefs 30:521-531, 2011) attribute to a natural cycle of disturbance and recovery. But there has been very limited recovery. While coral cover has increased for short periods on some individual reefs, it has declined sharply on many more to produce the observed system-wide trend of declining cover. Close to 40% of coral cover on inner reefs has been lost since 1986. Of particular significance is the new evidence that coral cover has remained unchanged or declined further from a low 1986 baseline in 28 out of 29 sub-regions of the Great Barrier Reef, indicating a gradual erosion of resilience that is impeding the capacity of this huge reef system to return towards its earlier condition. This result, and other clear evidence of widespread incremental degradation from overfishing, pollution, and climate change, calls for action rather than complacency or denial.	[Hughes, T.

Ecological incumbency impedes stochastic community assembly in Holocene foraminifera from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							RELATIVE SPECIES ABUNDANCE; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; INNER NERITIC SAND; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; FOSSIL RECORD; BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; COORDINATED STASIS; MULTIPLE SCALES	Persistence in the structure of ecological communities can be predicted both by deterministic and by stochastic theory. Evaluating ecological patterns against the neutral theory of biodiversity provides an appropriate methodology for differentiating between these alternatives. We traced the history of benthic foraminiferal communities from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. From the well-preserved uplifted reef terrace at Bonah River we reconstructed the benthic foraminiferal communities during a 2200-year period (9000-6800 yr sp.) of reef building during the Holocene transgressive sea-level rise. We found that the similarity of foraminiferal communities was consistently above 60%, even when comparing communities on either side of a massive volcanic eruption that smothered the existing reef system with ash. Similarly, species diversity and rank dominance were unchanged through time. However, similarity dropped dramatically in the final stages of reef growth, when accommodation space was reduced as sea-level rise slowed. We compared the community inertia index (CII) computed from the observed species abundances with that predicted from neutral theory. Despite the differences in foraminiferal community composition in the younger part of the reef sequence, we found an overall greater degree of community inertia with less variance in observed communities than was predicted from neutral theory, regardless of foraminiferal community size or species migration rate. Thus, persistent species assemblages could not be ascribed to neutral predictions. Ecological incumbency of established foraminiferal species likely prevented stochastic increases in both migrant and rare taxa at the Bonah River site. Regardless of the structuring mechanisms, our reconstruction of Holocene foraminiferal assemblages provides historical context for the management and potential restoration of degraded species assemblages.

Projecting Coral Reef Futures Under Global Warming and Ocean Acidification	SCIENCE			English	Review							CARBONATE-ION CONCENTRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; SATURATION STATE; BLEACHING EVENT; THERMAL-STRESS; RANGE SHIFTS; CALCIFICATION; GROWTH; EVOLUTION	Many physiological responses in present-day coral reefs to climate change are interpreted as consistent with the imminent disappearance of modern reefs globally because of annual mass bleaching events, carbonate dissolution, and insufficient time for substantial evolutionary responses. Emerging evidence for variability in the coral calcification response to acidification, geographical variation in bleaching susceptibility and recovery, responses to past climate change, and potential rates of adaptation to rapid warming supports an alternative scenario in which reef degradation occurs with greater temporal and spatial heterogeneity than current projections suggest. Reducing uncertainty in projecting coral reef futures requires improved understanding of past responses to rapid climate change; physiological responses to interacting factors, such as temperature, acidification, and nutrients; and the costs and constraints imposed by acclimation and adaptation.

For the Great Barrier Reef, are there historically stable southern refugia where corals from th north might migrate as climate changes? To address this question, we present a precise chronology of margina coral reef development from Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland, Australia. Our chronology shows that ree growth was episodic, responding to natural environmental variation throughout the Holocene, and tha Moreton Bay was inhospitable to corals for about half of the past 7000 years. The only significant change ii coral species composition occurred between similar to 200 and similar to 50 years ago, following anthropogenic alterations of th, bay and its catchments. Natural historical instability of reefs, coupled with environmental degradation sinc, European colonization, suggests that Moreton Bay offers limited potential as refuge habitat for reef species or human time scales.

The long-term history of living reef organisms provides an essential window in which to view a number of fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes over extended time frames not available to modern ecology over years or decades. Many of the constituents of modern reefs are calcifying organisms that leave a record of their presence in the fossil record. Thus, coral reef paleoecology has been undertaken on tropical ecosystems worldwide with applications in ecology, evolution, biogeography, extinction risk, conservation and management, and global change biology. Because many reef organisms secrete their calcareous skeletons at or near isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater, they have also been used to reconstruct environmental conditions over long time frames. The examination of ecological and evolutionary change in the context of environmental variability provides an ideal framework for understanding coral reef paleoecology and placing the modern biodiversity crisis in an historical context.

This study investigates the growth response of Marginopora vertebralis to enhanced terrestrially derived nitrogen and phosphate under both field and laboratory conditions. The field studies were conducted around the Whitsunday Islands in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, once during a peak flooding period and once during the dry season. During the flood season, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and particulate phosphate increased 2- to 5-fold from terrestrially derived runoff from the Proserpine River catchment compared to the dry season. Increased exposure to nutrients derived from terrestrial runoff negatively affected the growth rate of M. vertebralis in the field and in a comparative laboratory experiment. The field study showed a clear effect of site proximity to the river mouth and the intensity of the river discharge. Growth rates were higher in the reduced terrestrial runoff conditions at the offshore sites. When exposed to naturally enriched dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate in the laboratory experiment, growth rate of M. vertebralis was reduced 51 and 37 %, respectively, compared with ambient controls. Eutrophication likely causes destabilisation in the coupling of photosynthesis and growth within the photosymbiont by restricting photosynthate translocation to the host. In addition to nutrient effects, we also tested the effect of summer (28 degrees C) and winter (22 degrees C) temperatures on foraminiferal growth in the laboratory. Growth rates were significantly lower in the warmer treatment than in the cooler treatment. Therefore, both increased temperatures and higher nutrient concentrations appear to negatively affect growth in photosymbiont-bearing benthic foraminifera. Overall, management of local stressors (in this case nutrient runoff) might ameliorate the impact of climate change (increased temperature) on calcifying photosymbiont-bearing organisms.

Analysis of 47 surface sediment samples revealed 69 species, three distinct foraminiferal assemblages and six sub-assemblages. The assemblages from the western Bay are characterized by stress tolerant taxa and the lowest diversity, whereas the assemblages from the eastern Bay are characterized by symbiont-bearing taxa and high diversity. We found a correlation between foraminiferal assemblages and substrate conditions that was indicative of strong environmental gradients (substrate type, water quality and salinity), from an urban-impacted assemblage in the westernmost part of the Bay, to a hyposaline, estuarine-influenced assemblage in the western Bay to a nearly normal marine to hypersaline assemblage in the eastern Bay. The FORAM Index was consistent with the changes in water and sediment quality gradient, from the western shoreline to the eastern Bay. Thus the foraminiferal assemblages of Moreton Bay make excellent bio-indicators of environmental changes in a subtropical, estuarine setting in eastern Australia.

However, areas ranked highly for these factors may not represent regions of maximal evolutionary potential. The relationship between geography and evolutionary innovation was analyzed in a dominant complex of Caribbean reef corals, in which morphological and genetic data concur on species differences. Based on geometric morphometrics of Pleistocene corals and genetically characterized modern colonies, we found that morphological disparity varies from the center to the edge of the Caribbean, and we show that lineages are static at well-connected central locations but split or fuse in edge zones where gene flow is limited. Thus, conservation efforts in corals should focus not only on the centers of diversity but also on peripheral areas of species ranges and population connectivity.

We sampled the relative species abundance of coral, benthic foraminifera, and calcareous red algae communities from eight submerged coral reefs in the Huon Gulf. Papua New Guinea which formed during successive sea level fall and lowstand periods over the past similar to 416 kyr. We found that dissimilarity in coral species composition increased significantly with increasing time between reef-building events. However. neither coral diversity for the taxonomic composition of benthic foraminifera and calcareous red algae assemblags varied significantly over time. The taxonomic composition of coral communities from lowstand reefs, was significantly different from that of highstand reefs previously reported from the nearby Huon Peninsula. We interpret the community composition and temporal dynamics of lowstand reefs as a result of shifting energy regimes in the Huon Gulf, and differences between low and highstand reefs as a result of differences in the interaction between biotic and environmental factors between the Huon Gulf and Huon Peninsula. Regardless of the exact processes driving these trends, our study represents the first glimpse into the ecological dynamics of coral reefs during low sea level stands when climatic conditions for reef growth were much different and less optimal than during previously studied highstand periods.

Thresholds and multiple scale interaction of environment, resource use, and market proximity on reef fishery resources in the Solomon Islands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biomass midpoint; Coral reef; Regression tree; Human population; Spatial threat	PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA; CORAL-REEFS; ROVIANA LAGOON; SEA TENURE; COMMUNITIES; MARINE; SIZE; BIOMASS; EXPLOITATION; DEGRADATION	Reef fish are critical in maintaining the ecological function of coral reefs and providing food security for coastal communities in developing countries. Reef fishery stocks are under increasing threat from factors such as climate-related habitat degradation, land use practices, and resource extraction related to human population growth, direct consumption and increasing connectivity between the in situ fishery and fish markets. This study investigates how reef fish stocks are related to environmental, localised resource use and market proximity indicators across 51 sites in the Solomon Islands. Hard coral cover is the best indicator of total target fishery biomass, with cover of less than around 31% associated with significantly less biomass than sites with higher coral cover. Direct resource use indicators such as fish consumption and fish sale pressure were poor predictors of target fish biomass. Distance of the fishery resource from community, provincial sub-station, provincial capital and national capital are all significantly and positively correlated with biomass for four key fishery families: Acanthuridae (surgeonfish), Scaridae (parrotfish), Lethrinidae (emperor), Lutjanidae (snapper). Multiple spatial scale relationships are evident between market proximity indicators and Lutjanidae and Scaridae families. Thus, while pooled target fishery biomass is constrained by environment, analysis at fishery family resolution reveals the effects of anthropogenic impact through market proximity on constraining fishery biomass distribution in the Solomon Islands. This study highlights the need for reef fishery managers and conservation practitioners to focus attention on proximity of resources to markets to sustain the ecological health of reef dominated ecosystems.

High-precision U-series dating of very young cyclone-transported coral reef blocks from Heron and Wistari reefs, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Hurricanes and Typhoons - From the Field Records to the Forecast	SEP 25-28, 2006	Gulf Coast Assoc Geol Soc, Lafayette, LA	United Nat Int Geosci Program, Int Geosphere Biosphere Programme Past Global Changes	Gulf Coast Assoc Geol Soc		TROPICAL CYCLONE; FREQUENCY; WAVES; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; INTENSITY; DURATION; INCREASE; DEPOSITS; TSUNAMI	Numerous high-energy-transported coral reef blocks occur on the outer reef flats of Heron and Wistari reefs at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. In a pilot study, five samples from Heron and one from Wistari were collected for high-precision U-series dating by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Five of the six dated corals yield U-series dates that suggest these corals were killed and transported during the last century. Without precise knowledge of cyclone impacts in the area, it is not possible to unequivocally link these reef blocks to specific cyclones. Nevertheless, this pilot study demonstrates that cyclone-transported coral reef blocks over the past 300 years can be precisely dated to an age uncertainty of +/- 1-4 years. This opens up the opportunity for high-age-resolution reconstruction of cyclone history and high-precision assessment of the trend and frequency of cyclone occurrences over the past millennium, as well as for a better understanding of anthropogenic impact on cyclone activity.

Hopping hotspots: Global shifts in marine Biodiversity	SCIENCE			English	Review							INDO-PACIFIC; DIVERSIFICATION; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; ORIGINS; LABRIDAE; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIATION	Hotspots of high species diversity are a prominent feature of modern global biodiversity patterns. Fossil and molecular evidence is starting to reveal the history of these hotspots. There have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years. They have moved across almost half the globe, with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events. The birth and death of successive hotspots highlights the link between environmental change and biodiversity patterns. The antiquity of the taxa in the modern Indo- Australian Archipelago hotspot emphasizes the role of pre- Pleistocene events in shaping modern diversity patterns.	[Renema, W.; Wesselingh, F.

Escaping the heat: range shifts of reef coral taxa in coastal Western Australia	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; coral paleoecology; coral reef; Pleistocene; range shifts; Western Australia	RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; TAPHONOMIC ALTERATION; NETHERLANDS-ANTILLES; ACROPORA-CERVICORNIS; CARBONATE PRODUCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; LEEUWIN CURRENT	One of the most critical challenges facing ecologists today is to understand the changing geographic distribution of species in response to current and predicted global warming. Coastal Western Australia is a natural laboratory in which to assess the effect of climate change on reef coral communities over a temporal scale unavailable to studies conducted solely on modern communities. Reef corals composing Late Pleistocene reef assemblages exposed at five distinct localities along the west Australian coast were censused and the results compared with coral occurrence data published for the modern reefs offshore of each locality. The resulting comparative data set comprises modern and Late Pleistocene reef coral communities occurring over approximately 12 degrees of latitude. For the modern reefs this gradient includes the zone of overlap between the Dampierian and Flindersian Provinces. Modern reef coral communities show a pronounced gradient in coral composition over the latitudinal range encompassed by the study, while the gradient in community composition is not as strong for Pleistocene communities. Tropical-adapted taxa contracted their ranges north since Late Pleistocene time, emplacing two biogeographic provinces in a region in which a single province had existed previously. Beta diversity values for adjacent communities also reflect this change. Modern reefs show a distinct peak in beta diversity in the middle of the region; the peak is not matched by Pleistocene reefs. Beta diversity is correlated with distance only for comparisons between modern reefs in the north and the fossil assemblages, further supporting change in distribution of the biogeographic provinces in the study area. Coral taxa present in modern communities clearly expanded and contracted their geographic ranges in response to climate change. Those taxa that distinguish Pleistocene from modern reefs are predicted to migrate south in response to future climate change, and potentially persist in 'temperature refugia' as tropical reef communities farther north decline.

Morphology and ecological zonation of Caribbean reef corals: the Montastraea 'annularis' species complex	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Corals; Caribbean Sea; Coral reef ecology; Zonation; Ecotones; Morphometrics; Community assembly; Community structure; Evolution	BUILDING CORAL; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLEISTOCENE; HYBRIDIZATION; BOUNDARIES; EVOLUTION; SOLANDER; CURACAO; MEMBERS	Estimates of species diversity on coral reefs are extremely high, yet hidden biological diversity makes even these, underestimates. The morphological complexity in the Caribbean reef coral Montastraea 'annularis' was originally interpreted as a single species because colony growth form was highly correlated with depth distribution from the coral reefs surrounding Carrie Bow Cay in Belize. This 'species' has since been re-interpreted from other Caribbean reefs as representing at least 3 separate species based on morphometric, genetic, reproductive, and ecological differences. We revisited the shallow water coral reefs in the Carrie Bow Cay region to test whether the 3 species could be recognized, and if so, what their ecological distribution might be. We have found that the 3 recently described species of the Montastraea 'annularis' species complex can be readily identified using both colony forms observed in the field and morphometric analyses of the corallite wall, and that their abundance distributions vary significantly along depth gradients. Morphometric comparison with both colonies from Panama and results from transplantation experiments in Jamaica show consistent patterns in the morphological characters that differentiate species and growth forms and are useful in understanding the geographic, environmental, and genetic components of variability within the species complex. All 3 species have a broad depth distribution, but each species dominates in a preferred depth zone, suggesting a high degree of niche differentiation. Our results confirm the existence of hidden biological diversity in Caribbean reef corals and call for caution in future estimates of biological diversity on coral reefs.

A new, extinct Pleistocene reef coral from the Montastraea "annularis" species complex	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY			English	Article							BUILDING CORAL; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BOUNDARIES; CURACAO; GROWTH; FORM	A new species of the Montastraea "annularis" species complex is herein described from Pleistocene coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea. The species, Montastraea nancyi n. sp., had a broad geographic distribution at mainly insular sites 125 Ka. It has a fossil record extending from >600 Ka (thousand years) to 82 Ka, both first and last occurrences exclusively on the island of Barbados. It also had a broad environmental tolerance, occurring in fringing, windward back-reef and reef-crest, leeward reef-crest, and lagoonal patch-reef environments. In every habitat in which it lived, there are examples that it either dominated the coral fauna or shared dominance with Acropora palmata, a dominant shallow water coral in high-energy Pleistocene and modem reefs. The extinction of Montastraea nancyi resulted in evolutionary and ecological change in surviving members of the M. "annularis" species complex.

Time-averaging was assessed in uplifted Holocene reef sequences from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, using radiocarbon dating of coral skeletons in both horizontal transects and vertical sequences. Calibrated 2 sigma age ranges varied from 800 to 1060 years along horizontal transects, but weighted mean ages calculated from 15-18 dates per horizon were accurate to a resolution within 154-214 yr. Approximately 40% of the variability in age estimate resulted from internal variability inherent to C-14 estimates, and 60% was due to time-averaging. The accuracy of age estimates of sea level change in studies using single dated corals as proxies for sea level is probably within 1000 yr of actual age, but can be resolved to <= 250 yr if supported by dates from analysis of a statistical population of corals at each stratigraphic interval. The range of time-averaging among reef corals was much less than that for shelly benthos. Ecological time-averaging dominated over sedimentological time averaging for reef corals, opposite to patterns reported from shelly benthos in siliciclastic environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

No-take areas, herbivory and coral reef resilience	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; RESERVES	Coral reefs worldwide are under threat from various anthropogenic factors, including overfishing and pollution. A new study by Mumby et aL highlights the trophic relationships between humans, carnivorous and herbivorous fishes, and the potential role of no-take areas in maintaining vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. No-take areas, where fishing is prohibited, are vital tools for managing food webs, ecosystem function and the resilience of reefs, in a seascape setting that extends far beyond the boundaries of the reefs themselves.

Mass mortality following disturbance in Holocene coral reefs from Papua New Guinea	GEOLOGY			English	Article						coral reefs; disturbance; Quaternary; mass mortality; Holocene; Papua New Guinea	AGE CALIBRATION; RED-SEA; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS	The frequency and intensity of disturbance on living coral reefs have been accelerating for the past few decades, resulting in a changed seascape. What is unclear but vital for management is whether this acceleration is natural or coincident only with recent human impact. We surveyed nine uplifted early to mid-Holocene (11,000-3700 calendar [cal] yr B.P.) fringing and barrier reefs along similar to 27 km at the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. We found evidence for several episodes of coral mass mortality, but frequency was < 1 in 1500 yr. The most striking mortality event extends > 16 km along the ancient coastline, occurred ca. 9100-9400 cal yr B.P., and is associated with a volcanic ash horizon. Recolonization of the reef surface and resumption of vertical reef accretion was rapid (< 100 yr), but the post-disturbance reef communities contrasted with their pre-disturbance counterparts. Assessing the frequency, nature, and long-term ecological consequences of mass-mortality events in fossil coral reefs may provide important insights to guide management of modern reefs in this time of environmental degradation and change.

We report within habitat stability in coral community composition in the Pleistocene fossil record of Barbados for at least 95 000 years despite marked variability in global sea level and climate. Results were consistent for surveys of both common and rare taxa. Comparison of Pleistocene and modern community structure shows that Recent human impacts have changed coral community structure in ways not observed in the preceding 220 000 years.

However, when whole colonies are not available and surfaces are eroded, identification becomes problematic when relying on such characteristics. Characters based on internal skeletal structures are less prone to loss due to taphonomic processes. Previous work has shown that internal corallite architectural features measured in transverse thin sections can be used to distinguish species. To determine whether internal colony-level features measured on X-radiographs can be used. eight characters related to corallite budding and accretionary growth were measured on specimens representing three modern members of the M. annularis species complex (M. annularis, M. flaveolata and M. franksi), as well as two fossil forms (columnar and organ-pipe). All eight characters showed significant differences among species. Discriminant function analysis using seven of these characters resulted in distinct species groupings In canonical scores plots and a 100% classification success for specimens from Panama. These results suggest that measurements made on X-radiographs provide a useful tool for quantitatively distinguishing members of the M. annularis complex as well as between other massive reef corals.

J	Budd, AE; Pandolfi, JM				Budd, AE; Pandolfi, JM			Overlapping species boundaries and hybridization within the Montastraea "annularis" reef coral complex in the Pleistocene of the Bahama Islands	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; SPAWNING CORALS; BUILDING CORAL; SCLERACTINIA; CNIDARIA; COMMUNITIES; EXTINCTION; DIVERSITY; TURNOVER	Recent molecular analyses indicate that many reef coral species belong to hybridizing species complexes or "syngameons." Such complexes consist of numerous genetically distinct-species or lineages, which periodically split and/or fuse as they extend through time. During splitting and fusion, morphologic intermediates form and species overlap. Here we focus on processes associated with lineage fusion, specifically introgressive hybridization, and the recognition of such hybridization in the fossil record. Our approach involves comparing patterns of ecologic and morphologic overlap in genetically characterized modern species with fossil representatives of the same or closely related species. We similarly consider the long-term consequences of past hybridization on the structure of modern-day species boundaries. Our study involves the species complex Montastraea annularis s.l. and is based in the Bahamas, where, unlike other Caribbean locations, two of the three members of the complex today are not genetically distinct. We measured and collected colonies along linear transects across Pleistocene reef terraces of last interglacial age (approximately 125 Ka) on the islands of San Salvador, Andros, and Great Inagua. We performed quantitative ecologic and morphologic analyses of the fossil data, and compared patterns of overlap among species with data from modern localities where species are and are not genetically distinct. Ecologic and morphologic analyses reveal "moderate" overlap (>10%, but statistically significant differences) and sometimes "high" overlap (no statistically significant differences) among Pleistocene growth forms (= "species"). Ecologic analyses show that three species (massive, column, organ-pipe) co-occurred. Although organ-pipes had higher abundances in patch reef environments, columnar and massive species exhibited broad, completely overlapping distributions and had abundances that were not related to reef environment. For morphometric analyses, we used multivariate discriminant analysis on landmark data and linear measurements. The results show that columnar species overlap "moderately" with organ-pipe and massive species. Comparisons with genetically characterized colonies from Panama show that the Pleistocene Bahamas species have intermediate morphologies, and that the observed "moderate" overlap differs from the morphologic separation among the three modern species. In contrast, massive and columnar species from the Pleistocene of the Dominican Republic comprise distinct morphologic clusters, similar to the modern species; organ-pipe species exhibit "low" overlap (<10%, only at species margins) with columnar and massive species. Assuming that "moderate" overlap implies hybridization and "high" overlap implies more complete lineage fusion, these results support the hypothesis of hybridization among species within the complex in the Bahamas during the Pleistocene. Hybridization involved introgression of three distinct evolutionary lineages, in association with Pleistocene sea level and temperature fluctuations, and appears to have been limited geographically primarily to the Bahamas and the northern Caribbean. Thus, not only does the structure of species boundaries within the complex vary geographically, but these geographic differences may have persisted since the Pleistocene.

Persistence does not require lack of change or the absence of variation from one occurrence of the assemblage to the next in geological time. It does, however, imply that assemblage composition is bounded and that variation occurs within those bounds. The principal cause for these patterns appears to be species-, and perhaps clade-level, environmental fidelity that results in long-term tracking of physical conditions. Other factors that influence persistent recurrence of assemblages are historical, biogeographic effects, the "law of large numbers," niche differentiation, and biotic interactions. Much research needs to be done in this area, and greater uniformity is needed in the approaches to studying the problem. However, great potential also exists for enhanced interaction between paleoecology and neoecology in understanding spatiotemporal complexity of ecological dynamics.

Physical and biological taphonomic attributes measured from coral specimens showed great variability with respect to reef environment. Physico-chemical degradation (abrasion and dissolution) was greatest in reef-crest and patch-reef environments. With the exception of encrusting foraminifera, coverage by epi- and endobionts was higher in deep-reef environments (20 m and 30 m). Variability in dissolution and abrasion is likely the result of the different energy regimes present in the reef habitats examined. Variability in biological attributes results from a combination of increased residence time of coral skeletons on substrates in deep-reef environments, higher overall coral skeletal densities of corals inhabiting deep reef environments, and increased nutrient availability in the deep reefs sampled. Clear gradients in the degree of taphonomic alteration of reef corals with reef habitat indicate the utility of corals as taphofacies indicators in ancient reef settings. In contrast to shallow-water reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, taphonomic alteration of corals in the Florida Keys was equitable across growth forms.

Projected increases in carbon dioxide and temperature over the next 50 years exceed the conditions under which coral reefs have flourished over the past half-million years. However, reefs will change rather than disappear entirely, with some species already showing far greater tolerance to climate change and coral bleaching than others. International integration of management strategies that support reef resilience need to be vigorously implemented, and complemented by strong policy decisions to reduce the rate of global warming.

We compiled records, extending back thousands of years, of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores, herbivores, and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species, and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia, but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching. Regardless of these new threats, reefs will not survive without immediate protection from human exploitation over large spatial scales.

The ecological dynamics of Pleistocene coral communities varies with spatial and temporal scale of study. Reef coral communities studied over small spatial and temporal scales show ecological chaos where disturbance prevents ecological equilibrium, and those studied at the largest biogeographic scales show large differences due to history, chance, dispersion, and regional-scale processes. However, communities that are located within tens of kilometers of one another appear to show a large degree of order.. probably due to underlying principles of niche similarity. Similarly, temporal studies conducted over large temporal scales show persistence in coral community structure through tens of thousands of years. The history of Caribbean reef coral communities shows that this persistence has been recently interrupted by massive degradation of coral reef habitats. Whether such habitat reduction and change in species composition are unprecedented and due to the acceleration of human consumption and pollution, or whether they represent a short-term fluctuation in an otherwise predictable community structure, is one of the most important questions facing reef managers today. Investigations of coral community structure at different spatial scales illuminate the dependence of ecological dynamics on spatial scale, and at different temporal scales show that present trends are not predicted from history but may well be related to human-induced environmental modification.

Extinction of the organ-pipe Montastraea occurred after more than 500,000 years of dominance in the shallow-water reef habitat of Barbados. Extinction resulted in a morphological shift of the columnar Montastraea lineage from thick to thin columns in modern reef environments, Pleistocene colonies of the columnar morphotype sympatric with organ-pipe Montastraea showed greater column widths than those in allopatry. We subjected our data to a number of criteria for interpreting the morphological shift as character release following lifting of competitive pressure after extinction. The morphological differences do not appear to be due either to chance or to physical properties of the marine environment. Differential local extinction and recolonization of four members of the species complex did not occur on Barbados, so that the species coexisted and appear to have coevolved between more than 600,000 and 82,000 years ago. The morphological shift is related to coral growth form and growth rate, and thus reflects the acquisition of a primary resource in corals-lights. Character release occurred at the same oceanic Caribbean island (Barbados) where environments have fluctuated with similar variance throughout the period of coexistence. Not only has competition among living members of the Montastraea "annularis" species complex been convincingly demonstrated, but trends in relative abundance among fossil members of the species complex strongly suggest that a competitive hierarchy was operating during their Pleistocene coexistence on Barbados. We also observed an ecological analogue to character release on another Caribbean island, Curacao, The distribution and abundance of living columnar M. annularis s.s. and massive M. faveolata from the leeward reef crest in Curacao is greater now than in the Pleistocene, when organ-pipe Montastraea dominated this shallow-water reef habitat. Extinction of the faster growing, shallow-water organ-pipe Montastraea resulted in higher abundance of the columnar Montastraea lineage in shallow-water habitats, where it shifted its morphology to one adapted to high light levels. The species extinction released surviving lineages from a competitive network that had resulted in lower rank abundance in the Pleistocene community and enhanced abundance of both columnar M. annularis s.s. and AT faveolata in modern communities. Full validation of our interpretation of character release must await experiments that demonstrate whether phenotypic differences between populations have a genetic basis. However, we believe the results of this study point to the important, yet heretofore neglected, role that biological interactions have played in the evolution of closely related reef coral species.

An alternative hypothesis is that wide dispersal may be an incidental byproduct of an ontogenetic migration from and then back to the parental habitat. Under this hypothesis, the water column is a better habitat than the bottom for early development. Because the parental area is often an especially favorable habitat for juveniles and adults, selection may even favor larval retention or larval return rather than dispersal. Where larval capabilities and currents permit, a high percentage of recruits may then be produced from local adults. Expected consequences of a high proportion of local recruitment are stronger links between stock and recruitment, greater vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and local modifications of habitat, greater local benefits from fishery reserves, and possibly more localized adaptation within populations. Export of some larvae is consistent with a high proportion of retained or returning larvae, could stabilize populations linked by larval exchange, and provide connectivity between marine reserves. Even a small amount of larval export could account for the greater gene flow, large ranges, and long evolutionary durations seen in species with long pelagic larval stages.

The diversity and taxonomic composition of Holocene raised fossil reefs was compared with those of modern reef coral life and death assemblages in adjacent moderate and low-energy shallow reef habitats Of Madang Lagoon, Papua New Guinea. Species richness per sample area and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') were highest in the fossil reefs, intermediate in the life assemblages, and lowest in the death assemblages. The taxonomic composition of the fossil reefs was most similar to the combination of the life and death assemblages from the modern reefs adjacent to the two fossil reefs. Depth zonation was recorded accurately in the fossil reefs. The Madang fossil reefs represent time-averaged composites of the combined life and death assemblages as they existed at the time the reef was uplifted. Because fossil reefs include overlapping cohorts from the life and death assemblages, lagoonal facies of fossil reefs are dominated by the dominant sediment-producing taxa, which are not necessarily the most abundant in the life assemblage. Rare or slow-growing taxa accumulate more slowly than the encasing sediments and are underrepresented in fossil reef lagoons. Time-averaging dilutes the contribution of rare taxa, rather than concentrating their contribution. Consequently, fidelity indices developed for mollusks in sediments yield low values in coral reef death and fossil assemblages. Branching corals dominate lagoonal facies of fossil reefs because they are abundant, they grow and produce sediment rapidly, and most of the sediment they produce is not exported. Fossil reefs distinguished kilometer-scale variations in community structure more clearly than did the modern life assemblages. This difference implies that fossil,reefs may provide a better long-term record of community structure than modern reefs. This difference also suggests that modern kilometer-scale variation in coral reef community structure may have been reduced by anthropogenic degradation, even in the relatively unimpacted reefs of Madang Lagoon. Holocene and Pleistocene fossil reefs provide a time-integrated historical record of community composition and may be used as long-term benchmarks for comparison with modern, degraded, nearshore reefs. Comparisons between fossil reefs and degraded modern reefs display gross changes in community structure more effectively than they demonstrate local extinction of rare taxa.

Paleoecological, archaeological, and historical data show that time lags of decades to centuries occurred between the onset of overfishing and consequent changes in ecological communities, because unfished species of similar trophic level assumed the ecological roles of overfished species until they too were overfished or died of epidemic diseases related to overcrowding. Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.

Patterns of community differentiation analyzed at both species and genus levels showed only small differences using different numerical scales (relative abundance, rank abundance and species presence and absence). Whereas some differences were observed between species and genus level patterns, they had little effect on paleoecological interpretations. The greatest differences occurred when presence and absence analyses of assemblages sampled along 40-m transects were compared with those sampled along 40-m transects augmented by a one-hour search for rare taxa. These results suggest that paleoecological interpretations of Quaternary coral communities are robust to numerical scale of analysis at the species and genus level, and to taxonomic scale between the species and genus level. However, interpretations of community structure are sensitive to sampling intensity, geographic scale, and sample size.

Living reefs generally accumulate in place, so fossil reefs record a history of their former biological inhabitants and physical environments. Reef corals record their ecological history especially well because they form large, resistant skeletons, which can be identified to species. Thus, presence-absence and relative abundance data can be obtained with a high degree of confidence. Moreover, potential effects of humans on reef ecology were absent or insignificant on most reefs until the last few hundred years, so that it is possible to analyze "natural" distribution patterns before intense human disturbance began. We characterized Pleistocene reef coral assemblages from Curacao, Netherlands Antilles, Caribbean Sea, focusing on predictability in species abundance patterns from different reef environments over broad spatial scales. Our data set is composed of >2 km of surveyed Quaternary reef. Taxonomic composition showed consistent differences between environments and along secondary environmental gradients within environments. Within environments, taxonomic composition of communities was markedly similar indicating nonrandom species associations and communities composed of species occurring in characteristic abundances. This community similarity was maintained with little change over a 40-km distance. The nonrandom patterns in species abundances were similar to those found in the Caribbean before the effects of extensive anthropogenic degradation of reefs in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The high degree of order observed in species abundance patterns of fossil reef coral communities on a scale of tens of kilometers contrasts markedly with patterns observed in previous small-scale studies of modern reefs. Dominance of Acropora palmata in the reef crest zone and patterns of overlap and nonoverlap of species in the Montastraea ''annularis'' sibling species complex highlight the tendency for distribution and abundance patterns of Pleistocene corals to reflect environmental preferences at multiple spatial scales. Wave energy is probably the most important physical environmental variable structuring these coral communities. The strong similarity between ancient and pre-1980s Caribbean reefs and the nonrandom distribution of coral species in space and time indicate that recent variability noted at much smaller time scales may be due to either unprecedented anthropogenic influences on reefs or fundamentally different patterns at varying spatio-temporal scales.

The windward reef crest sediment is the most distinctive, dominated by fragments of encrusting and branching coralline red algae, coral fragments and the encrusting foraminiferan Carpenteria sp. Windward back reef and leeward reef crest sediments are more similar compositionally, only showing significant differences in relative abundance of coral fragments and Homotrema rubrum. Although lacking high taxonomic resolution and subject to modification by transport, relative abundance of constituent grain types offers a way of assessing ancient skeletal reef community composition, and one which is not limited to a single taxonomic group. The strong correlation between grain type and environment we found in the Pleistocene of Curacao suggests that constituent grain analysis may be an effective tool in delineating Pleistocene Caribbean reef environments. However, it will not be a sufficient indicator where communities vary significantly within reef environments or where evolutionary and/or biogeographical processes lead to different relationships between community composition and reef environment. Detailed interpretation of geological, biological, and physical characteristics of the Pleistocene reefs of Curacao reveals that the abundance of the single coral species, Acropora palmata, is not a good predictor of the ecological structure of the ancient reef coral communities. This coral was the predominant species in two of the three reef habitats (windward and leeward reef crest), but the taxonomic composition (based on species relative abundance data) of the reef coral communities was substantially different in these two environments. We conclude that qualitative estimates of coral distribution patterns (presence of a key coral species or the use of a distinctive coral skeletal architecture), when used as a component in a multi-component analysis of ancient reef environments, probably introduces minimal circular reasoning into quantitative paleoecological studies of reef coral community structure.

In the first study, Pleistocene reef coral assemblages from Papua New Guinea show pronounced constancy in taxonomic composition and species diversity between 125 and 30 ka (thousand years). Spatial differences in reef coral community composition during successive high stands of sea level were greater among sites of the same age than among reefs of different ages, even though global changes in sea level, atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical benthic habitat area, and temperature varied at each high sea level stand. Thus, local environmental variation associated with runoff from the land had greater influence on reef coral community composition than variation in global climate and sea level, Proportional sampling from a regional species pool does not explain the temporal persistence and local factors likely played a major role. Examination of coral reef response to global change should not only involve regional diversity patterns but also local ecological factors, and the interactive effects of local and global environmental change. In the second study, Pleistocene extinction of two widespread, strictly insular species of Caribbean reef corals, Pocillopora cf. palmata (Geister, 1975) and an organ-pipe growth form of the Montastraea "annularis" species complex, was natural and did not involve gradual decrease in range and abundance, but was sudden (thousands of years) throughout the entire range. One explanation is that sea level drop at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM-18 ka) resulted in a threshold of habitat reduction, and caused disruption of coral metapopulation structure. Threshold effects predicted by metapopulation dynamics may also explain the apparent paradox of the large amount of degraded modern reef habitat without any known modern-day reef coral extinctions, The rapid extinction of widespread Pleistocene species emphasizes the vulnerability of reef corals in the face of present rapid environmental and climatic change.

The Holocene and Pleistocene fossil record of coral reefs from this region potentially provides a wealth of long-term ecologic information with which to assess the historical record of changes in shallow water coral reef communities. Before fossil data can be applied to the modern reef system, critical problems involving fossil preservation must be addressed. Moreover, it must be demonstrated that the classic reef coral zonation patterns described in the early days of coral reef ecology, and upon which "healthy" versus "unhealthy" reefs are determined, are themselves representative of reefs that existed prior to any human influence. To address these issues, we have conducted systematic censuses of life and death assemblages on modern "healthy" patch reefs in the Florida reef tract that conform to the classic Caribbean model of reef coral zonation, and a patch reef in the Bahamas that is currently undergoing a transition in coral dominance that is part of a greater Caribbean-wide phenomenon. Results were compared to censuses of ancient reef assemblages preserved in Pleistocene limestones in close proximity to each modern reef. We have determined that the Pleistocene fossil record of coral reefs may be used to calibrate an ecological baseline with which to compare modern reef assemblages, and suggest that the current and rapid decline of Acropora cervicornis observed on a Bahamian patch reef may be a unique event that contrasts with the long-term persistence of this taxon during Pleistocene and Holocene time.

J	Pandolfi, JM; Greenstein, BJ				Pandolfi, JM; Greenstein, BJ			Preservation of community structure in death assemblages of deep-water Caribbean reef corals	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							BLACK BAND DISEASE; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF	An in situ survey of deep reef environments (20 and 30 m) was conducted to determine the degree to which the community structure of live reef coral assemblages was faithfully represented in the adjacent death assemblages accumulating on the sea floor. Relative abundance of species was significantly different between life and death assemblages, and zonation patterns (in species relative abundance, coral growth form, and diversity) present in the life assemblages showed both similarities and differences to those found in the death assemblages. The difference in species distribution patterns between Life and death assemblages is shown by a striking growth form bias in the death assemblage: species with massive growth forms are underrepresented in the death assemblages in both environments, whereas branching, encursting, and plate growth forms are overrepresented in the death assemblages. Several factors may be involved in the life and death assemblage differences: greater degrees of time averaging than in previously studied reef settings, changes in the life assemblage such that death assemblages record previous life assemblages more faithfully than present ones, and undersampling of massive corals in death assemblages. Comparison of species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity between life and death assemblages produced unexpected results. In general, death assemblages showed higher diversity than did life assemblages, more in accordance with previous studies of shelly molluscan faunas of temperature and tropical level-bottom marine communities than with those of shallow-water coral reef communities. Because our results differ from previous studies of community preservation in coral reefs, we recommend that paleoecological studies of aquatic ecosystems be accompanied by preservational assemblages from the same or similar environments. Our results point to the subtleties involved in interpreting coral death assemblages and suggest that these assemblages may contain as much or more information on recent changes in the Living reef as they do on the future composition of the fossil reef assemblages.

J	Greenstein, BJ; Pandolfi, JM				Greenstein, BJ; Pandolfi, JM			Preservation of community structure in modern reef coral life and death assemblages of the Florida Keys: Implications for the Quaternary fossil record of coral reefs	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CONSTANCY	The reef fossil record is the exclusive database from which analyses of the response of coral communities to environmental change over geological time scales may be gauged. However, few studies have attempted to ascertain whether the reef fossil record is a reasonably accurate representation of a once living coral community. To address this issue, we first assume that an assemblage of dead corals accumulating in close proximity to a living coral reef(including the dead portions of living colonies) provides a reasonable proxy for the material that potentially becomes fossilized We then perform a systematic comparison of the taxonomic composition and diversity present in coral life assemblages and death assemblages accumulating in reef tract and patch reef environments adjacent to Key Large, Florida. The death assemblage is distinct from the life assemblage, but matches exactly the zonation of live corals between reef tract and patch reef environments. The difference in taxonomic composition between life and death assemblages is the result of a striking growth form bias in the depth assemblage: massive coral colony forms predominate in the life assemblages in both environments, whereas branching colony forms predominate in the death assemblages. Calculations of species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity produced conflicting results. At one reef tract site, the death assemblage was more diverse than the life assemblage. Unlike the Indo-Pacific, the subset of the life assemblage retained as recognizable corals in the death assemblage is not less diverse. We attribute this difference to a more diverse "starting pool" of live corals in the Indo-Pacific. Fidelity indices were similar to those calculated for life and death assemblages occurring in the Indo-Pacific, but very different than those compiled for molluscan shelly assemblages. If the death assemblages we examined represent a reasonable proxy for a potential fossil assemblage, analyses of relative changes in coral reef community structure during Quaternary time should provide reliable base line data for assessing the response of modern Caribbean reefs to global change.

J	Pandolfi, JM; Greenstein, BJ				Pandolfi, JM; Greenstein, BJ			Taphonomic alteration of reef corals: Effects of reef environment and coral growth form .1. The Great Barrier Reef	PALAIOS			English	Article							BIOEROSION; SHELL	Taphonomic alteration in coral death assemblages showed high variability with respect to reef environment and growth form at Orpheus Island on the Great Barrier Reef Australia. A greater degree of physical and biological alteration occurred in the lower-energy leeward Pioneer Bay site relative to the higher-energy windward Iris Point site. Greater degrees of taphonomic alteration also occurred at 6-7 m than 2-3 m water depth within each site. Clear gradients in the degree of taphonomic alteration of reef corals with reef environment indicate the utility of corals as taphonomic indicators in ancient reef settings. Because greater taphonomic differences between depths occurred at the high wave-energy site relative to the lour wave-energy site, differentiation of fossil reef taphofacies might be greatest in high energy reef settings. Interpretation of ancient reef sedimentary environments may be aided by analysis of taphonomic alteration. of reef corals. Massive corals suffered greater degrees of biological and physical alteration than free-living corals which suffered greater alteration than branching corals. The greater taphonomic alteration in more robust massive coral growth forms from Orpheus Island concurs with other studies that have suggested that bioerosion may be related to overall skeletal area and density, and amount of skeleton not covered by living tissue during the life of the coral. In addition, relative differences in production of coral morphotypes might result in. a greater number of less degraded branching than massive corals. A possible explanation for the two observations that corals in higher wave energy environments are less degraded than those from lower wave energy environments, and that fragile are better preserved than robust coral growth forms, is the differing amount of post-mortem residence time the corals spend in the 'taphonomically active zone'.

The two methods agree closely from 120 ka to 80 ka and from 20 ka to 0 ka (ka = 1000 yr before present), but between 70 and 30 ka the isotopic sea levels are 20-40 m lower than the Huon Peninsula sea levels derived in earlier studies. New, high precision U-series age measurements and revised stratigraphic data for Huon Peninsula terraces aged between 30 and 70 ka now give similar sea levels to those based on deep sea oxygen isotope data planktonic and benthic delta(18)O data. Using the sea level and deep sea isotopic data, oxygen isotope ratios are calculated for the northern continental ice sheets through the last glacial cycle and are consistent with results from Greenland ice cores.

J	Pandolfi, JM				Pandolfi, JM			Limited membership in Pleistocene reef coral assemblages from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea: Constancy during global change	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Review							SEA-LEVEL CHANGES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; YOUNGER DRYAS; RECORD; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; HISTORY; ENVIRONMENTS	One of the most intriguing questions in community ecology remains unanswered: Are ecological communities open assemblages with each species reacting individually ro environmental change, or are they integrated units consisting of multispecies assemblages acting in concert? I address this question for marine organisms by examining the taxonomic composition and diversity of Indo-Pacific reef coral communities that have undergone repeated global change between 125 and 30 Ka (thousand years before present) Investigation of community constancy through time relies on two critical questions: (1) Are there significant differences in taxonomic composition among communities from different times? and if not, (2) Are the observed patterns in temporal similarity significantly different from Expected patterns resulting from a random sampling of the available within-habitat species pool? Constancy in taxonomic composition and species richness of Pleistocene reef coral assemblages is maintained through a 95-k.y. interval in the raised reef terraces of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. Fossil reef coral assemblages show limited membership in species composition despite repeated exposure to marked fluctuations in sea level (up to 120 m) and sea-surface temperatures (up to 6 degrees C). During the 95-k.y. interval, the reefs experienced nine cycles of perturbation and subsequent reassembly with similar species composition. Spatial differences in reef coral species composition were greater among the three study sites than amen reefs of different ages. Thus local environmental parameters associated with riverine and terrestrial sources had a greater influence on reef coral composition than global climate and sea level changes, The ecological dynamics of reef communities from Papua NEW Guinea are in marked contrast to those of Quaternary terrestrial and level bottom marine communities which appear to show unlimited community membership on both larger and smaller time scales. Differences in community assembly among ecosystems mean either that coral reefs are fundamentally different or that different ecological patterns and processes are occurring at different temporal scales.

J	Pandolfi, JM; Minchin, PR				Pandolfi, JM; Minchin, PR			A comparison of taxonomic composition and diversity between reef coral life and death assemblages in Madang Lagoon, Papua New Guinea	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CARBONATE; ISLANDS; RECORD	The comparative taphonomy of reef coral life and death assemblages makes an important contribution in estimating bias in the taxonomic composition of fossil reef ecosystems. In Madang Lagoon, Papua New Guinea, the taxonomic composition of reef coral death assemblages shows varying degrees of congruence with adjacent life assemblages in fringing reefs. The original composition of coral communities from low energy reef crest sites appears to be more mixing of populations obscures the original coral composition. Coral death assemblages from low energy reef crest habitats may represent autochthonous deposits retaining some of the original community structure, whereas those from high energy reef crest habitats may represent detrital deposits retaining little of their original ecological information. In addition, coral zonation patterns appear to be better preserved at broad than local spatial scales. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener index of diversity and evenness of life and death assemblages were constant between sites and depths in Madang Lagoon. For all three parameters, however, diversity of reef coral death assemblages is significantly less than that of the corresponding life assemblages. This may be due to the unique life history attributes of reef corals. The great longevity of many reef corals may exceed the amount of time needed to degrade their skeletons. Alternatively, only a subset of the life assemblage is being selectively incorporated into the death assemblage. Published measures of fidelity for non-reef marine environments are different from those found in the reefs of Madang Lagoon. In Madang Lagoon reef corals, many live taxa are not found dead, but most taxa in the death assemblage are found alive. The situation is reversed in shelly faunas from non-reef open marine, coastal and intertidal settings: most live taxa are found dead and few taxa in the death assemblage are found alive. As with the diversity results, this probably has to do with the unique life hi;story of reef corals and/or selective preservation of a subset of taxa in the death assemblage. It may be, however, that the present study is not directly comparable to the other marine studies because (1) corals may undergo very different taphonomic processes from both reef and non-reef molluscs; and (2) the sampling regime of the present study, in targeting within- and between-habitat variability in preservation of taxonomic composition and diversity, may be different from previous studies. The community ecology approach utilized in the present comparative taphonomic study was sufficient to capture the high variability inherent in marine life and death assemblages.

Excellent preservation of coral reef communities occurs along the ancient atoll rim and within the central lagoon. The previously interpreted depositional nature of the fossil atoll structure is herein corroborated with geomorphologic and stratigraphic evidence from previously un-visited portions of the island. Stratigraphic and lateral facies relationships indicate a physiographic zonation which includes spur and grooves, outer reef flat, lagoon margin, and an interior lagoon with patch reefs. The in situ occurrence and zonation of reef coral communities around the periphery and within the interior of the island appear to reflect the original physiography of the atoll lagoon, with the most pronounced reef development on the SE side of the original atoll. Stratigraphic units which comprise the raised atoll lagoon structure represent different time intervals, so the atoll lagoon structure formed during various sea level fluctuations. The modern atolls of the Pitcairn Group, Oeno and Ducie, provide some comparisons (similarities and differences) with the fossil lagoon on top of Henderson Island.

Constituent particle analyses comparing sediments that received starfish carcasses to those that did not revealed that, after a four year interval, the mass mortality was reflected by elevated abundances of starfish ossicles in 1-2 mm and 2-3 mm size classes, but not in > 4 mm and 0.5-1 mm size classes. Additional field study of starfish taphonomy revealed that the abundance of starfish ossicles in surficial sediments decreases through two orders of magnitude between two weeks and four years post-mortem, while tumbling experiments suggest that the size distribution of starfish ossicles is modified by physical processes: the < 0.5 mm size classes increases at the expense of the > 4 mm class. Taphonomic biasing increased the abundance of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) skeletal elements in the 0.5-1 mm size fraction, while the 1-2 mm size and 2-4 mm fractions produced the most reliable signature of starfish mass mortality based on element abundance. Our results demonstrate the importance of taphonomic processes in altering the original size frequency distribution of the COTS skeleton and their potential for biasing predictions of past population levels derived from constituent particle analyses of surficial reef sediments.

Reduction in the highest level of survival of intertidal massive corals was used as a proxy for assessing the amount of coseismic uplift over 45 km of the Huon coastline. Measurements were gathered from three sites one and three months after the earthquake. Sea-level pressure gauges in place in the northern end of Sialum Lagoon showed not uplift, but subsidence, from the earthquake. Uplift ranged from approximately 7 to 13 cm, and subsidence ranged from 8 to 14 cm. The May 15, 1992, earthquake corroborates the coseismic origin of the raised reef terraces of the Huon Peninsula. Greater uplift of the land in the southeast relative to the northwest is consistent with the regional Quaternary uplift pattern. The close proximity of subsidence (shown by sea-level gauges) to uplift (shown by coral mortality) is a manifestation of the abundant fault blocks in the area. Uplift rates of 3.0-5.2 m/ka calculated from the earthquake are only marginally higher than previous estimates based on radiometric age dates and terrace geomorphology. The first directly observed earthquake uplift event on the Huon Peninsula has yielded only centimetre-scale coseismic uplift. Thus, individual Holocene and Pleistocene terraces thought to have been the result of metre-scale displacement from single earthquakes may rather have been due to successive episodes of centimetre-scale uplift on constructional reef platforms. The clustered history of earthquakes on the Huon Peninsula throughout the past 100 years indicates the complexity involved in assessment of seismic risk throughout the world.

A cladistic biogeographic analysis of the genera Symphyllia (Milne Edwards & Haime. 1848) and Coscinaraea (Milne Edwards & Haime, 1848) yielded three patterns. (1) Indo-Pacific reef coral species ranges overlap in a west to east stepwise fashion with the closest biogeographic relationships occurring between adjacent areas. These area relationships show a marked congruence with the Cenozoic geologic history of the Indo-Pacific. (2) The region represented by southeastern and southwestern Australia appears to be biogeographically distinct from both the north and western Indo-Pacific and the eastern Indo-Pacific. In Western Australia, controls over the biogeographic distribution of species of the two genera studied appear to be a function of latitudinally related environmental parameters. (3) Species with relatively derived character states display a higher degree of endemism than species which show relatively primitive character states. The relatively derived coral species showing the highest degrees of endemism exist at the periphery of Indo-Pacific reef coral distributions. Thus, many reef coral species must have originated far from the Indo-West Pacific centre of diversity. Congruence between the geologic history of the Indo-Pacific and the biogeographic area relationships suggest successive isolation as a working hypothesis for the origination patterns of Indo-Pacific reef corals. Species origination in reef corals was a response to geologic events that resulted in successive isolation of populations at various times and in various places during the Cenozoic history of the Indo-Pacific. It is suggested that future biogeographic studies do not confine themselves to diversity maps, but use species level phylogenetic information in constructing biogeographic hypotheses.

The evidence lies in the abundance of COTS skeletal elements found both on the sea floor and within the underlying sedimentary record. These studies are flawed in three respects. First, the processes of fossil preservation from the living population to the fossil assemblage have been ignored. Second, it has not been demonstrated that the fossil skeletal elements representing alleged outbreak populations of starfish are of the same age. Third, the existence of a relationship between the number of COTS skeletal elements sampled from the sedimentary record and the relative abundance of COTS in the once living population has not been substantiated. The limitations introduced when studying the fossil record need to be established through taphonomic analyses of the COTS. Techniques which will allow greater temporal resolution of skeletal element age include amino-acid geochronology, analysis of sedimentation mode and rate, and correlation among sub-surface cores. In order to establish a relationship between the number of fossil COTS elements and the original population size, methods must be developed which will relate the number of fossil skeletal elements to the relative abundance of starfish in both the fossil and death assemblages and then to relate the latter to the relative size of the original population. When these approaches are used together it may be possible to make some estimate of relative COTS abundances based on data contained in the fossil record.

No significant genetic differentiation was observed between habitats or between reefs. The highly significant genetic differentiation observed between replicate samples within only one habitat was the result of the abundance of a second clone at one site on Davies reef flat and did not reflect a consistent pattern of spatial differentiation within habitats. No evidence suggested that different sibling species, or indeed different clones, were present in different habitats. The low genetic distance (average Nei's D = 0.017, highest < 0.057) indicated high gene flow among populations up to 100 km apart. Shallow water habitats suitable for M. vertebralis between segments of the Great Barrier Reef may provide a route for gene exchange between populations. Phenetic analyses of banding patterns for esterase provided similar evidence of a high degree of homogeneity between the populations sampled. Significant heterozygote deficits in most samples showing variation was consistent with a high degree of asexual reproduction in M. vertebralis.
